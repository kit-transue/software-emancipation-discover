<!-- The language for a GCC compilation is based the suffix,
     possibly overridden by -x <language>.
     If no suffix is recognized, the gcc compiler does not default to
     C or C++, but assumes an object file which we need to ignore.

     This file exists so that gcc.xml will handle the -x c++ option correctly.
