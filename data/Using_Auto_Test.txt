AUTO TEST TOOL						January 11, 1993


    The auto test tool allows you to write scripts in English for automatically
testing ParaSet.  With it you can push menu buttons, select list items,
type into editors, and other actions.  For example, if you want to 
    								

USING THE TOOL:

    Typing "-test" followed by a file name will run the tool on the file.
Example:
	aset -test /users/oak/as/auto_test/src/menubar_test

Unfortunately ParaSet will only take one file name after any extension.  To
run more than one file sequentially use the RUN command described later in
the grammar section.  


THE AUTO TEST LANGUAGE:

    The lexer and parser recognize the following words and grammars with
one command per line.  
	
    Reserve Words (Case insensitive):
	all 		back		browser 	button 		clear
	click 		column 		control 	debug		dialog
	drag		editor 		enter 		file 		from
	go		goto 		horizontal 	in 		item
	list 		lock 		mb1 		mb2 		mb3
	menubar 	meta 		mouse 		move 		on
	print		project 	push 		run		select
	set 		shell 		shift 		speed		text
 	times 		to 		tree		type		unselect
 	vertical 	viewer 		viewershell

    Strings
	Anything enclosed in double quotes and residing on one line.
	Examples: Goto project browser "Test Project"
		  Type "/users/aset-integ/ui/browser\n"

    Ordinal Numbers
	Any number followed by "rd", "st", "nd", or "th".  Whatever is 
	correct given the last digit in the number.  
	Examples: 1st 2ND 3rD 4Th

    Whole Numbers
	0, 1, 2, 3, ...

    Comments:
	/**** C comments on multiple lines ****/
	// C++ comments.

    Grammar:
	EOL, an end of line.
	STRING, a string in double quotes.
	NTH, an ordinal number.
	NUMBER, a whole number.
	All other words in capital letters are reserved words.

	command:	location_command EOL    
		|	action_command EOL	

	location_command:  GOTO location	
    		|	GOTO NTH location    	

	location:	BROWSER		
		|	VIEWER 	
		|	VIEWERSHELL	
		|	LIST		
    		|	DIALOG STRING    	
		|	STRING	

	action_command:  DEBUG
		|	PRINT TREE
		|	PUSH BUTTON STRING
		|	CLICK ON STRING	
		|	CLICK MOUSEBUTTON number_of_clicks	
		|	MOVE MOUSE TO NUMBER ',' NUMBER		
		|	DRAG MOUSEBUTTON TO NUMBER ',' NUMBER		
		|	SET SPEED TO NUMBER
		|	menubar_command push_command_list	
		|	SELECT STRING 	
		|	SELECT NTH STRING
		|	SELECT FROM NTH STRING TO NTH STRING 
		|	UNSELECT ALL	
		|	IN LIST SELECT STRING	
		|	IN LIST SELECT NTH ITEM	
		|	IN TEXT EDITOR STRING ENTER STRING
		|	CLEAR TEXT EDITOR STRING
		|	TYPE modifier_key_list STRING

		;

	menubar_command:	IN MENUBAR PUSH STRING 

	push_command_list:	/* empty */
    		|	push_command_list PUSH STRING	
		;

	modifier_key_list:	/* empty */
		|	modifier_key_list SHIFT	
    		|	modifier_key_list LOCK		
    		|	modifier_key_list CONTROL	
    		|	modifier_key_list META		
    		;

	number_of_clicks:	/* empty */		
		|	NUMBER TIMES			
		;



FLOW OF CONTROL:

   The parser grammar rules are divided into location commands and
action commands.  
   Location commands move the focus up and down in the user interface widget 
tree.  To effectively take visible location names and get the desired widgets
the parser uses the GOTO NTH command and a visible path lookup table.  It also
keeps track of the current widget top level, the current visible
path, and the widget index.  

Say we execute the following commands (the indentation is unnecessary):

	Goto Browser
		Goto "Group List"
		Go back
	Go back
	Goto 1st ViewerShell
		Goto 1st viewer

The Parser recognizes this as the following:

GOTO BROWSER 	Points all actions to the Browser window. 

GOTO STRING	Points actions to the location given by string.  

GO BACK		Pops the last location off the visible path stack.  In this
		case we go back to the Browser.  The last location on the
		stack is always an invisible pointer to the top level of 
		the application.  It is never popped off the list.

GO BACK		This call is good style but unnecessary.  The following commands
		clear the visible path before executing:
			GOTO BROWSER
			GOTO NTH BROWSER
			GOTO VIEWERSHELL
			GOTO NTH VIEWERSHELL


GOTO NTH VIEWERSHELL 	Points action to the nth viewerShell in order of creation. 
			In this case the "1st" field was unnecessary.

GOTO NTH VIEWER 	Points action to the nth viewer.


   Action commands use or reference widgets that are at or below the 
current top level. 
Examples:
	Set speed to 100
	In menubar push "View", push "New Viewer"

SET SPEED TO NUMBER	Sets the speed of the mouse.

IN MENUBAR PUSH STRING ',' PUSH STRING ',' PUSH STRING	Makes choices in the
							menubar.

Since the user interface has many duplicates, you must use location 
commands to move you to the area to work in.  Here are the same location
commands and action commands in a working script:

	Set speed to 100
	Goto Browser
		In menubar push "View", push "New Viewer"
	Go back
	Goto 1st ViewerShell
		Goto 2nd viewer


EXAMPLE FILE

    This example file is taken from /users/oak/test_scripts/hyperlinks.auto
and is the beginning of the hot links demo.  Unfortunately at the
time of writting, importing to a project does not work so this file
is dependent on the project in /users/oak/junk/.  Note that the 
indentation in the file is not necessary.

/*_______________________________________________________________________
!
! hyperlinks.auto
!
! Synopsis:	Tests the hot links.
!
_______________________________________________________________________*/

Set speed to 100 // Slow enough to see.

//
// Bring up requirements.txt in a viewer.
//
Goto Browser
//	Click on "Project Editor"
//	Clear text editor "Project Editor"
//	Type "/local/junk\n"

	Goto "Project List"
		Goto "List"
			Move mouse to 10,10
			Click mb1 2 times
			Click mb1 2 times
			Go back
		In list select 3rd item
		Go back
	In menubar push "View", push "Text"
	Go back
Goto ViewerShell
	Goto viewer
		Goto view
			Select "Description"
			Select from 1st "X" to 1st "Requirements"
			Go back
		Go back
	In menubar push "File", push "Close Window"
	Go back
Goto Browser
	In menubar push "Browser", push "Quit ParaSET"
	Goto dialog "Save Files"
		Push button "Save"



VISIBLE NAMES

    Some controls in the system have no obvious names, such as
the small text editor under the directory label in the browser.
So, we have given names to most of these widgets.  The following 
is a list of all visible names in the system and where they lie
in the hierarchy.  The most current list can always be found
in $(INTEGROOT)/cmd/include/cmd_menu_names.h.
