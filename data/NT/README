DISCOVER for Windows NT


Known Issues
============

As of this release, DISCOVER for Windows NT has the following known
issues:

  o If DISCOVER suddenly switches back to the ServiceChooser (a
    pset_server crash), you cannot go back to the Browser by clicking the
    Start button. Instead, you must exit and restart DISCOVER

  o When applying a rule set to a large Information Model, the DISCOVER main
    window does not refresh. DISCOVER is operating properly, however, and
    will refresh the screen upon completion of the application of the rule
    set

  o When working with groups, you may want to view entities in the Entities
    column on the Groups page in the browser notebook. You can use the
    clipboard to paste the entities, as follows:

    1. After applying a rule set to the Information Model, select the entities
       that appear in the Results column of the Model Browser.

    2. Select Copy from the Edit menu.

    3. Select the Browser notebook, and select the Groups page.

    4. Select an item in the Categories and Operation columns, until one or
       more items appear in the Entities column.

    5. Select one or more items in the Entities column (this highlights the
       items, enabling DISCOVER to paste to the correct location)

    6. Select Paste from the Edit menu.

    This interface is being considered for revision in future releases.

  o Applying a rule set that contains a type-matching rule for "short int"
    does not find entities of the type short int. Use "short" instead of 
    "short int" when you want to locate entities of this type.

  o If you use the Shift and arrow keys to select entities or instances (for
    example, in the Elements column in the Model Browser), be careful that you
    have selected the entities you intended to select. The most recently
    highlighted item is not actually selected. You can verify this by counting
    the number of items you have selected, then comparing it to the number
    that appears in the Filter List button at the bottom of the column. This 
    issue will be addressed in future releases.

  o When working with .make rule in a project description file (.pdf), the
    command string that will be passed on to the Windows NT command
    interpreter is converted to lower case.

  o DISCOVER integration with Visual C++ 5.0 does not contain Information
    Model for Microsoft Foundation Classes.

  o During your installation, you may see the following message:

    Setup has detected that Visual C++ 4.x or 5.x is not installed 
    properly for a current user on this computer.
    Setup will not be able to integrate with Visual C++.
    Would you like to continue?

    This message occurs for one of two reasons:

    1. Visual C++ is not installed, or is incompletely installed
    2. Visual C++ is completely and properly installed, but has never
       been run by the current user

    In the first case, click No in the message dialog box. This exits
    the Setup installation wizard. You can then confirm that Visual
    C++ is properly installed. When you have done this, restart Setup
    and continue with your DISCOVER installation. Please note that to
    integrate DISCOVER with Visual C++, Visual C++ must already be
    installed when you begin installing DISCOVER.

    If you do not want to integrate DISCOVER with Visual C++, click
    Yes in the message dialog box, and continue with the
    installation. When Setup is nearly finished, it will remind you
    that it was unable to integrate DISCOVER with Visual C++.

    In the second case (Visual C++ is installed but has not been run
    by the current user), click No in the message dialog box. This
    exits the Setup installation wizard. Run Visual C++, and exit it
    (this identifies Visual C++ with the current user). Restart Setup,
    and continue with the installation.

    If Visual C++ 4.x and 5.x both exist on your system, DISCOVER will
    prompt you to select a version. You can integrate DISCOVER with
    only one version at a time. To integrate with another version, you
    must uninstall DISCOVER, then select the desired version of Visual
    C++ when you reinstall DISCOVER.

Note: If DISCOVER terminates unexpectedly, you should remove any
DISCOVER temporary files or directories from C:\TEMP\ (or your
designated temporary directory).
