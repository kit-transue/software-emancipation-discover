Creating, and Running Regression Tests for aset_CCcc
====================================================

1. Create a directory that can be used as the regression test directory
   for aset_CCcc

	use 'testct.sh' script to create such directory:

		$1:	the name of the regression test directory;
			by default $1 gets set to ./testedg

		$2:	the name of the directory that contains
			source code (C, and C++ files); these are the
			files that will constitute the regression suite


	the test directory will contain three subdirectories:

		base:	the .if files that will be used as the reference
			when comparing with the new version of aset_CCcc

			NOTE: PATH (which) is used to resolve aset_CCcc
			      that is used to build these reference .if
			      files

		source:	the .[cC] files that new aset_CCcc will use to
			generate the corresponding .if files

		log:	log directory

	example:

		$ cd /net/slice/sunny/edg.2.37.xtra_pos/release/tests
		$ testct.sh /users/tests/edg.2.37

2. Use 'testedg.sh' to run regression tests

	$1:	the name of the regression test directory;
		by default $1 gets set to ./

	$2:	the location of aset_CCcc to be tested;
		be default $2 gets resolved with `which aset_CCcc`

	the results should be logged to some file in the log directory

	example:

		$ cd /users/tests/edg.2.37/log
		$ testedg.sh /users/tests/edg.2.37 /bin/sun5-O/6.0.0.8/aset_CCcc > 6.0.0.8.log
