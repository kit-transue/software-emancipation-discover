NAME:
    access_test
 
USAGE:

  access_test [-env env_file] [-file script_name] [-email user_id] [-help]

This script is a tool to run a set of access test scripts on a given pdf non-interactively. The access test scripts are run in a pmod_server environment. Each access test script has its own validation criteria. The summary report generated by the tool gives the number of scripts that succeeded/failed, along with the environment that was used for running the tests. Environment includes all the environment variables used, architecture of the machine on which they were run, name of the user who ran the tests.

NOTE: This tool assumes that the model is already built

OPTIONS:

-env env_file	: specifies the file (env_file) to be used for test environment . If this option is not specified, the tests are run on the DISCOVER Learn environment. The environment file MUST define an enviroment variable "pdf_file" pointing to the pdf file on which the tests are to be run. Any other environment variables used in the pdf file should also be defined in this environment file. 

-file script_name	: runs the specified access test script "script_name" instead of all of the standard access tests

-email user_id	: If this option is specified, the summary file to mailed to user_id. Right now this works only on Unix systems and not on Windows NT.

-help	: Display help file for the tool
