How To Apply a Patch from SET to Your Discover
==============================================

1. Look into the Discover distribution you want to patch. Find the README file.
   For Example, if you want to patch the $PSETHOME directory, look for the
   $PSETHOME/README file. 

2. If you don't have this file. Your patch level is base (or 00). 
   If you see the file, go to the bottom of the README file. Get the 
   largest (latest) patch No. you see. That is your current patch level.

3. Anonymous FTP to set.cybercom.net . 

4. Get the shell script apply_patch in pub/patches/bin if you don't have it 
   in your $PSETHOME/bin.
   
5. Go to pub/patches/"platform"/"release"

6. Look for the patch files you need and get them. For example, if your
   current patch level is 02, you may want to get 03.tar.Z, 04.tar.Z ...
   If you patched all of them, your discover distribution will be
   identical with the latest Discover ship tape.

7. Quit FTP. Uncompress the patch files.

8. Untar the tar file with the command "tar xf the_tar_file_name". Now you
   should see directories like 03, 04, etc.

9. cd to where you installed the Discover, like "$PSETHOME". Run apply_patch 
   script. It will ask you for the path of the patch you want to apply.
   Then you type in the path like /"path"/03 . Hit <return>. The script 
   will apply this patch and update README for you.

   Please make sure that you apply the patches one by one and in the 
   right order. If your current patch level is n, always apply patch n+1 next.

10. check the README file.

11. Repeat step 9 and 10.
