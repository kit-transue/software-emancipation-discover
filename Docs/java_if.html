<p>
This document specifies the IF which will be produced by
DISCOVER's Java front end, and which drives the model build.
Because IF is already used for the languages C, C++, and PL/SQL,
and because the Java language is in most respects a subset of C++,
most of the requirements and decisions are already determined.
The IF for Java will use the same operators and relations
that are being used by C++, to the extent that Java is a subset.
The issues which need to be settled, and which this document
will emphasize, relate to those features which are unique to Java.
</p>
<h3>Symbols</h3>
<p>
<table width="30%" border>
<tr><th colspan="2">Symbol Kinds
<tr><th>new<th>not used
<tr><td><code>interface</code><td><code>struct</code><br>etc.
</table>
</p>
<p>The <code>package</code> symbol kind will be used for Java packages.
This kind is not used by C++, but is used by PL/SQL. 
Java uses it in a more sophisticated way than PL/SQL.
</p>
<p>
Package names will be included in the IF, as SYM lines with kind <code>package</code>.
Interfaces will have kind <code>interface</code> in their SYM lines. No other kind names 
are particular to Java. In particular, method symbols will have kind <code>function</code> on
their SYM lines, even though they should be displayed to the user as "method".
</p>
<p>Member symbol names will appear qualified by their classes or interfaces.
Class and interface names will appear qualified by their package (if any).
For example,
<pre>
    SYM [1] function "java.lang.String.indexOf(char)"
</pre>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>
<table width="30%" border>
<tr><th colspan="2">Attributes
<tr><th>new<th>not used
<tr><td><code>transient
<br>final
<br>synchronized
<br>abstract
<br>native</code>
<td><code>auto</code>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>abstract</code> attribute is used for methods and classes.
It's an explicit keyword in Java, in contrast to C++ where the corresponding
properties of abstract class and pure virtual member function are implicit.
<li>The <code>native</code> attribute applies to methods and corresponds to
the Java keyword.
<li>The <code>destructor</code> attribute will appear for "finalize" methods.
<li>The <code>virtual</code> attribute will be used for method symbols
that are not declared <code>final</code>.
<li>The <code>auto</code> attribute does not apply to Java.
</ul>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>
<table width="30%" border>
<tr><th colspan="2">Relations
<tr><th>new<th>not used
<tr><td><code>context&nbsp;package<br>import</code>
<td><code>type&nbsp;reference<br>type&nbsp;pointer<br>type&nbsp;const</code>
</table>
</p>
<p>
As with C++, the type of each field or method will be given as a <code>type</code> relation
of the symbol.
Structured types will be described using the <code>type</code> relation with the
attributes <code>return</code> and <code>argument</code> (noting that in Java <code>reference</code>, <code>pointer</code>, and <code>const</code>
do not apply to types).
</p>
<p>As with C++, the <code>context</code> relation will be given for members, with the appropriate
<code>public</code>, <code>package</code>, <code>protected</code>, or <code>private</code> attribute. 
The <code>context</code> relation will also be given for members of a package.
</p>
<p>The new <code>import</code> relation is used as follows:
<blockquote><code>REL [&lt;file&gt;] "import" [&lt;symbol&gt;]</code></blockquote>
where <code>&lt;symbol&gt;</code> is either a type symbol or a package symbol.
The <code>import</code> relation indicates <em>explicit</em> importation by
means of an <code>import</code> statement at the beginning of the compilation unit.
The <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> symbol represents the Java compilation unit.
</p>
<p>
Note that because Java classes can directly contain initialization blocks,
the <code>uses</code> relation of a class can indicate more than just the
class's members.
</p>
<p>Other relations that have direct C++ counterparts are supported,
for instance the <code>call</code> relation.
The <code>subclass</code> relation is used both when a Java class
<code>extends</code> a class and when it <code>implements</code> an interface.
</p>

</table>
</p>
<p>

<h4>method invocation</h4>
Method invocation will be of the form
<pre>
   call_expr {
     function [method symbol] {}
     variable [object-of-call symbol] {}
     [ &lt;argument&gt; ... ]
   }
</pre>
or in case of a static method
<pre>
   call_expr {
     function [method symbol] {}
     [ &lt;argument&gt; ... ]
   }
</pre>
The first operand of <code>call_expr</code> is the method to be called, using the <code>function</code>
operator.
The remaining operands of <code>call_expr</code> represent the argument list of the 
method. 
If the method is non-static, then the first argument indicates the object
for which the method is called.
</p>

<p><h4>object references</h4>
Java has no address-of or indirection operators. Nor does it have explicit reference types.
Nevertheless, object types are passed as references and object declarations declare
references. 
The simplest operations in Java involve the basic types and object references.
The AST code for a name reference in the simple case will be a <code>variable</code>
tree node. 
In the case of a reference to a field, the AST code will look like
<pre>
    component_ref [type-symbol] {
      variable [object-symbol] {}
      field [field-symbol] {}
    }
</pre>
Name references will have this form regardless of whether the context is any of the following:
    <ul>
    <li>a fetch (<code>name + 99</code>)
    <li>assignment to a name (<code>name = 99</code>)
    <li>passing an argument (<code>foo(name)</code>)
    </ul>
</p>

<p><h4>statement with explicit constructor invocation</h4>
Java permits the first statement of a constructor to be an explicit
invocation of a constructor for this class or for the superclass.
Semantically, the corresponding C++ construct is the base class initializer,
which has its own peculiar syntax.
The possibility of mimicing the C++ AST in this case was considered,
but it really gains nothing over simply emitting a <code>call_expr</code>.
The <code>call_expr</code> is distinguished by its method being a constructor,
which otherwise does not occur directly within a block.
This will generate AST as follows:
<pre>
     ast_block {
       call_expr [4]  {
         function [11]  {}
         super {}                        (or this {})
         [ &lt;argument&gt; ... ]
       }
       [ &lt;statement&gt; ... ]
     }
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<h4><code>break</code> and <code>continue</code></h4>
The Java <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements accept an optional
label indicating the construct to break out of or to reenter.
The Java parser will emit the usual <code>exit_stmt</code>
with either 0 or 1 operand, depending on whether the label is present.
Until now, <code>exit_stmt</code> has not had an operand.
</p>

<h4>import</h4>
<p>An <code>import</code> statement is represented by means of
existing operators with C++ oriented names.
<pre>
     using_decl {
       used_entity [sym] {}
     }
</pre>
</p>
There is no distinction in the AST between the Java constructs
<pre>
     import a.b.*
</pre>
importing all inner classes of a class, and
<pre>
     import a.b
</pre>
importing the class itself.      

<h4>declarations</h4>
<p>
Java declarations resemble C and C++ declarations, but there are significant differences in
formal syntax. 
<ul>
<li>In a method or field declaration, the type spec always comes just to the
left of the declarator(s).
<li>A class definition is its own, first-class declaration, with its own
set of declaration modifiers.
</ul>
</p>
<p>To support the latter we will have
<pre>
     type_decl_modified [class_sym] {
       ast_declspec
       name_clause {
         class [class-sym] {}
 	[ ast_superclass {
 	    class [sym] {}
 	  }
         ]
 	[ implements {
             interface [sym] {}
           }
           ...
         ]
       }
       ast_block {
         [ &lt;declaration&gt; ... ]
       }
     }
</pre>
What's different here is first the <code>ast_declspec</code> as the first operand 
of the <code>type_decl_modified</code>, and second the <code>name_clause</code> may contain
<code>implements</code> operators to indicate a set of interface types.
</p>

<p>To support the nicely-positioned type specs in method and field declarations,
the IF AST will have:
<pre>
     list_decl  {
       ast_declspec  {
         typespec [type-sym] {}
       }
       field_decl [declared-sym]   {
         field [declared-sym]  {}
         &lt;initializer&gt;
       }
     }
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<h4>funky declarators</h4>
Java offers the ability to declare array objects with the <code>[]</code> brackets
indicating one dimension of an array in either the type specifier or the
object declarator, or even in both. This provides a bit of a challenge when
generating IF. Here's an example of how it will be handled. Source code:
<pre>
	int [] aa [] = new int[2][2];
</pre>
Resulting IF:
<pre>
        list_decl_typed 1/2 29 {
          ast_declspec 1/2 6 {
            typespec [symbol for int[]] 1/2 6 {}
          }
          var_decl [symbol for aa] 1/9 21 {
            variable [symbol for aa] 1/9 2 {}
            java_vec_new 1/17 13 {
              type [symbol for element type] 1/21 3 {}
	      dimensions 1/24 6 {
                constant [constant symbol] 1/25 1 {"2"}
                constant [constant symbol] 1/28 1 {"2"}
              }
            }
          }
        }
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<h4>empty statement</h4>
<dd>An empty statement will yield no operators in the AST.

<h4>descriptions of new AST operators</h4>
<table border>
<tr><th>kinds<td>
<dl>
<dt><code>interface</code>
<dd>The <code>interface</code> operator corresponds to the new <code>interface</code> kind.
It has no operands but always references an interface symbol.
</dl>
<tr><th>declarations<td>
<dl>
<dt><code>type_decl_modified</code>
<dd>This is a variant of the <code>type_decl</code> operator, 
with a first operand inserted to indicate modifiers to the declared
class or interface.
<dt><code>initialization_block</code>
<dd>introduces initializing code
within a class definition. This declaration is a sibling to <code>list_decl</code>
declarations of the class members.
<dt><code>implements</code>
<dd>For the <code>implements</code> clause of a class declaration, as in the
example above. Takes one operand, the implemented interface symbol.
<dt><code>throw_spec</code>
<dd>The <code>throw_spec</code> operator optionally follows
the last <code>parm_decl</code> in a <code>function_decl</code>.
Its operands are <code>type</code> operators.
<dt><code>typespec</code>
<dd>The <code>typespec</code> operator is a leaf (i.e. has no operands).
It occurs as an operand to <code>ast_declspec</code> to represent
the type specifier of the declaration specifiers.
It always has a symbol id, indicating the appropriate type symbol.
</dl>
<tr><th>statements<td>
<dl>
<dt><code>synchronized</code>
<dd>The <code>synchronized</code> operator represents a statement, takes two operands:
<ol><li>the object to be locked
    <li>the statements to execute in a synchronized manner
</ol>
<dt><code>finally</code>
<dd>Up to now, the <code>try_block</code> operator took operands as follows: first
an <code>ast_block</code> operand, then one or more <code>catch</code>
clauses. With Java, there is an optional last operand that is a <code>finally</code>
clause. The <code>finally</code> operator has one operand which is an <code>ast_block</code>.
</dl>
<tr><th>expressions<td>
<dl>
<dt><code>instanceof</code>
<dd>The <code>instanceof</code> operator takes two operands:
<ol><li>an object reference expression
    <li>a type name
</ol>
It performs a test of whether the object's (dynamic) class
implements the given type, returning a true/false value.
<dt><code>this</code>
<dd>The <code>this</code> object, whether explicitly or implicitly referenced,
is represented in the AST by the <code>this</code> operator.
Having an operator to serve for <code>this</code> differs from the
way C++ uses a symbol for the same purpose. The <code>this</code> operator has no operands.
<dt><code>super</code>
<dd>The <code>super</code> operator has no operands. It represents the
current (<code>this</code>) object as implemented in its superclass.
<dt><code>easy_new</code>
<dd>The <code>new</code> operator in Java is much less complex than C++.  For C++ <code>new</code>
you have first the symbol id of the <code>new</code> function to call, then the following
operands.
    <ol>
    <li value="1">constructor call expression, with <code>dynamic_init</code>
    <li>cleanup function (in case constructor fails?)
    <li>amount of storage to allocate
    </ol>
    <code>easy_new</code> will take just 1 operand, the constructor call or anonymous class expression.
<dt><code>anonymous_class</code>
<dd>The <code>anonymous_class</code> operator occurs in <code>easy_new</code> expressions,
and takes 2 operands.
   <ol>
   <li>the constructor call
   <li>an <code>ast_block</code> tree for the class body
   </ol>
<dt><code>java_vec_new</code>
<dd>The <code>new</code> operator for arrays in Java is quite different from C++.
<code>java_vec_new</code> will have a type operand followed by a dimensions operand.
The type operand gives the element type of the array.
<dt><code>dimensions</code>
<dd>The second operand of <code>java_vec_new</code>, its operands are a variable
number of dimension operands. 
Each operand provides the size of one dimension.
<dt><code>lrshift_expr</code>
<dt><code>lrshift_assign_expr</code>
<dd>
Because Java has no unsigned types, it makes up for this by having two kinds of
right shift operations. The ordinary shift is based on the arithmetic value
of the left operand, in which shifting by one bit is equivalent to a reasonable
variant of division by 2. The alternative form is written <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
and indicates a "logical" right shift in which the effect of shifting by one bit
is to move each bit to the next less significant place, while filling the most significant
bit with 0.
<br>These two shift operators are in all other respects similar to <code>arshift_expr</code> and <code>arshift_assign_expr</code>.
<dt><code>class_literal</code>
<dd> A class literal expression, e.g. <code>boolean.class</code>, is expressed
in the AST using the <code>class_literal</code> operator. It takes no operands,
and indicates the type symbol of the class in question.
<dt><code>parens</code>
<dd>An expression using parentheses for grouping. Takes one operand, the
contained expression.
<dt><code>unary_plus</code>
<dd>An expression with a unary plus operator. Takes one operand, obviously.
</dl>

<h3>Unicode</h3>
<p>
Java is based on the Unicode character set.
We don't encounter this immediately when looking at typical Java source code,
because today's Java compilers are designed to work with today's text editors, which use ASCII.
Escape sequences, such as <code>\u2603</code>
are used to extend ASCII and incorporate Unicode characters into Java source.
Non-ASCII characters can occur in literals and in identifiers.
The EDG Java front end
is throughly based on the principle that the characters of a Java program
are Unicode characters, representing identifiers, characters, and strings using
Unicode.
Since every Unicode character has several possible ASCII representations
in Java, a good Java front end quickly loses track of the original representation. 
</p>
<p>IF represents identifiers and strings based on the way they appear in source code.
The source representation (including quotes if it's a string) is quoted.
<blockquote><small>In my opinion, when quoting a string all included double-quotes and backslashes
should be escaped using a backslash, so as to be able to find the concluding
quote mark in a standard way. This is not handled consistently at present
within DISCOVER.</small></blockquote>
Java identifiers, characters, and strings will likewise go into IF using a
quoted source-like representation.  Because a Java front end loses information, the
representation from the actual source file will not always be duplicated.
(Note also that a given identifier can be spelled different ways in the
source file itself.)</p>
<p>
Here are examples of four different source code constructs and how they appear in IF.

<center>
<table border>
<tr><td>           <th>identifier w/ Unicode<th>string w/ Unicode
                   <th>string w/ Unicode<br>alternate representation<th>string w/ backslash
<tr><th>source file<td><code>F\u00deirst</code>
                   <td><code>"F\u00deirst"</code>
                   <td><code>\u0022F\uu00deirst"</code><td><code>"\\u"</code>
<tr><th>string value<td>
                   <td><code>F&THORN;irst</code>
                   <td><code>F&THORN;irst</code><td><code>\u</code>
<tr><th>IF file    <td><code>"F\\u00deirst"</code><td><code>"\"F\\u00deirst\""</code>
                                                  <td><code>"\"F\\u00deirst\""</code>
                                                  <td><code>"\"\\\\u\""</code>
</table></center>
</p>
<p>This is not a big deal, but it can be confusing since strings and identifiers
go through so many stages of manipulation, and because IF is not currently used
in a well-defined and consistent way when dealing with special characters within strings.
