Subject: sw contract for re-use
From: Trung Dung

0   Description:

    The ability to re-use a sw component well is an evolving process. It
begins when the programmer first starts using the components and it ends
when he changes his career (or becomes a manager :-). During the lifetime
of this process an (implicit) contract is established between the component
experts and the users. This contract is helpfull for the process of
software reuse to evolve!

    Thus, the activities of software reuse can be thought as surrounding
the following tasks: identification, selection, and contract. In other
words, reuse starts with identification of potential components. Then final
candidates for reuse are obtained through a process of selections. When
users are actually reusing some component, an (implicit) contract is
established between component experts (ie. owners) and component users
regarding various issues like: enhancement, modification, bugs, requests,
documents, information, etc.

    A software reuse contract governs activities among component experts
and users. For example, component expert can use this medium to notify
users of enhancement, modification, bugs, plans, etc. Vice versa,
components users can use this medium to report bugs, enhancement requests,
communicate experiences, make queries, maintenence issues, etc.

I   Requirement:

II  Entity SW_Contract : SDO_base
    a) purpose: to aid the process of reusing sw

    b) attributes: 
	* name, owner, 
	* SWProject trg_software: the sw system that is being re-used
	* char *in-box: 

    c) relations:
	* Entity_relation: code_entities, docs, 
	* Relational:
	  * [SWProject, reuse_sw]: the trg_software of this contract

    d) behavior: 
	* Query/Function:
	  * get_users, 
	  * get_experts, 
	  * get_re_use_code(all/developer)
 	* Filter:
	* Action: 
	  * ask_question(user/expert):
	* View: intersection, union, difference, erd

    e) 	Trigger:
	* check-in
