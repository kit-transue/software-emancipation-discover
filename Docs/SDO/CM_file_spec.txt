Subject: CM file spec and design
From: Trung Dung


I   Requirement:
    * How many bug fixes were done to : subsystem, file, function,
      objects for a period of time?
    * How many LOC, entities were added/modified/pruned: for a period
      of time, with a particular submission, by a team, by an
      individual for a project, subsystem, file, function, object?
    * # of defects per LOC, per # of entities of subsystem (baseline),
      file, project, whole model?
  *** Traceability (modified history) on entity level (instead of just file
      level).

II  Entity CM_file : SDO_base
    a)	purpose: adding modified/new/delete entities history per file during
	check-in: 

    b) 	attributes:
	* enum entity_action { MOD, NEW, DEL }
	* name
	* History: capture information like ci, modified entities, comment,
	  etc. Could have format: [date, user, code_entity, MOD, comment]

    c)	relations:
	* Relational: 
	  * [Status, check-out] : track who currently check this file out.

    d) behavior: 
	* Query/Function:
	  * get_checkout_users()
	  * get_modified_entities(from_date, to_date)
 	* Filter:
	* Action: 
	  * combine: when merging diff. files to one,
	  * split: when spliting file into different files,
	* View: union

    e) 	Trigger:
	* check-in: remove [Status, check-out] relation, update history
	* check-out: establish [Status, check-out] relation
	* merge_file: merge diff. files to one
	* split_file: split file into different files
