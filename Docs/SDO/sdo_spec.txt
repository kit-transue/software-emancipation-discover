Subject: SDO spec and design
From: Trung Dung

I   SDO app design:

    0.  SDO description

    SDO app defines the following [high level objects] entities:
Ownership, Status, SW_Project, SW_Contract, CM_File.  Each entity consists
of a set of attributes, actions and will serve a particular purpose. Each
entity will also inherit from a base entity called SDO_base which provide
common utilities.

    SDO app defines 2 sub [ala. auxiliary, dependent] entities:
code_status<ent> which provide the connection to Discover pmod and
History<ent> which tries to capture activities applied to entity.  The sub
entity is removed upon its last reference in entity ent.

    a)	Entity code_status<entity Ent>
	#include <code_status_ent.txt>
    
    b)	Entity History<entity Ent>
	#include <history_spec.txt>

    SDO app will have a triggering mechanism which will invoke SDO server
activities when some other actions occur in some other servers.

    	Trigger definition:
	    * action,
	    * entity type,
	    * propagation type: self, broadcast
	    * hooks,
	    * data

    1.	Entity Ownership
	#include <ownership_spec.txt>

    2.	Entity Status
	#include <Status_spec.txt>

    3.	Entity SW_Project
	#include <SWProject_spec.txt>

    4.	Entity SW_Contract
	#include <contract.txt>

    5. 	Entity CM_File
	#include <CM_file_spec.txt>


II  Issue:

    * 	Formalize History, History <-> entity

    * 	Submission form, procedure, view, report? computable from Status
	history?

    *  	Model: last modified date for modified objects.

    *	Interface to project management tools?

    *   ??? propagation of change and storage of notification: if a function
is modified, get ownerships and notify appropriate owner, but also store
the short notification on the ownership object itself. The whole mechanism
should be done as much relational like as possible. How to define such
behavior generically? should use something like an in-box to deposit
notification? ???

    * 	Incorporate FAQ into SDOs: SW_Project ?
