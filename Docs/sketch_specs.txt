                                 Sketching

    1. User customizable palettes of graphical elements: shapes, connectors etc.

    2. "Prefabricated" palettes of shapes and connectors reflecting various methodologies.

    3. Free positioning of shapes on "paper"

    4. Semiautomatic connecting between shapes.

    5. If diagram type is specified then elements that do not belong to this type either should be dimmed on the palette or special palette should be displayed.

    6. Diagramming toolbar should be able to serve several windows (ie., each window becomes current at the click of a mouse on it).

    7. Freeform diagrams (sketches) can be saved "as is" or "straightening up" can be applied. Additionally, integrity check should be carried out (similar to syntax checking) before filing sketch away.

    8. Drawn objects can be named using typing, pointing to other objects in browser, other diagram, source code, etc.

    9. Sketch ma be "soft associated" with an appropriate set of other elements in the system: docs, source, subsystems, etc. (SDO)

    10. When user wants to incorporate sketch into a model, button "update" should be depressed. An appropriate consistency and completeness checks will have to be performed. (SDO)
