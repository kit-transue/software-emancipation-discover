I.  Using the Client


A.  Getting Started

This applet is designed to run as part of the Intranet.  A user
simply needs to go to the correct location in Netscape, where they
will find a java applet that they can use to edit and modify the 
daily progress report.

First, start Netscape.  If you are on a unix machine, simply type
"netscape" at the shell.  If you are on an NT box, double click
on the Netscape icon (you may have to install Netscape on your 
machine first.  There is a setup executable at \\phish\netscape).

Once Netscape comes up, there is a "Location" field.  Type in the
address of the desired page (this is currently 
"http://groucho/daily.html").

The Java Applet should then load.  It is a scrolling text field 
with a series of buttons at the bottom.


B.  Logging In

When the applet first comes up, you will see a message box 
prompting you for your username.  This is so that the server can
keep track of when the last time you downloaded the file in order
to warn you that the contents are changed.  It is also used to lock
a cell so that other people cannot alter it while you are editing
it.  

After you have logged in, The file will load into the editor.  This
should not take more than a couple of seconds.  You can reload the
file at any time by clicking the "reload" button.  Currently there
are four columns: Action, Due, Status, and Assignee.  If there is
more text than can be displayed, the text will be clipped.


C.  Editing a Cell

In order to edit a cell, select the cell and click "Edit."  This 
will lock the cell so that no one can make alterations while you
are in the middle of making a change.

A dialog box will appear with fields for each of the elements, with
the current values filled in.  After you have made your changes,
click "OK."  This will update the server with the new values, and
cause the page to reload.  Click "Cancel" to display the dialog box
without saving any changes.

If the page has been altered since the last time you have
downloaded the page, you will get a warning and the page will 
reload.  You will need to click Edit again, since the contents of
your cell may have changed.

If someone has locked your cell because they are editing it, you
will get a warning message telling you who has it, and asking you
if you want to steal it from them.  In general, stealing is only
for cases where netscape crashes while someone is in the middle of
an edit, and they never unlocked the cell.  However, if someone
does steal your lock while you are in the middle of editing, when
you try to save your changes, you will be given a warning message.


D.  Creating a New Cell

Click on the "Create" button.  A dialog box will come up, similar
to the one for editing a cell.  When you click okay, a new cell
will be created with your values at the end of the document.


E.  Moving a Cell

Click on the "Move" button.  A dialog box with the current row
number of the cell will appear.  Type in the new row number that 
you would like the cell to have, and click okay.


F.  Delete a cell

Click on the "Delete" button.  You will be prompted to make sure
that you really want to do this, and a click on "OK" will delete
the cell.


G.  Getting at the Raw File

If you would like to see the raw file, go to the location:
	http://groucho/daily_progress.4.1

The file will load in as raw text, at which point you can save it
to your local machine.

On the current page, there is actually a link to the raw data.

Once you have the file, you can load it into Excel or Word or any other
program that converts data in a tab-delimited format into a table.


H.  Running outside of Netscape

If you have java installed (currently only for NT and sun5), the
applet can be run as a stand-alone application.  Go to the location
of the Applet .class files (TBD), and run:
	
	java SpreadsheetApplet <hostname> <port> <file>

Currently, hostname is groucho, port is 4000, and file is 
daily_progress.4.1




------------------------------------------------------------

II.  Using the Server


A.  Installing

In order to interact with Netscape, the Server must be running on
the same machine as the web server.  JDK must be installed on this
machine.  

Somewhere on the machine, the .class files associated with the
Server must be stored.  The data files that are being viewed by
the clients will also need to be on this machine, probably in the
same directory, but not necessarily.


B.  Running

Go to the directory where the .class files live, and type:

	java Server <portnum>

Currently, we are using port 4000.  

When a client connects, it will request a specific file.  If the
file has already been loaded up by the applet, it will output the
cached data.  If it hasn't, it will load up the file.  When the
client makes a change, the cache is written out to the file.

For WWW purposes, a web surver must be running.  Currently, the Personal
Web Server, which is part of the ChameleonNFS package is being used.

Each time the server is rebooted, the java Server and the web server *must*
be restarted for any effect.

C.  Creating a New File

Before a file can be used, it must consist of two lines: a line of
weights and a line of column headings.

The weights specify how much of the line should be taken up by each
column.

All cells must be separated by tabs.  This is how the Server and
Client distinguish between columns, as well as allowing 
applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel to load up the file.

If some initial data is going to be included, it must contain
values for all cells.  If a cell is intentionally supposed to be
blank, use an underscore ("_") in its place.  The program uses 
these as place holder, and they will show up as blank spaces in
the program.

Here is a sample five column file:

10	20	10	5	10
Name	Address	Phone #	Age	Spouse
Alex	25 Nowhere St.	555-1212	23	Joan
Beth	1 Beacon St.	123-4567	28	Bob
Jim	2 Sutton Place. Apt 3	567-8901	30	_

D.  Modifying an Existing File

A file cannot be changed by hand while the Server is running.  It
will continue to export its cached data and overwrite the file the
next time a change is made by a client.  Even if this were not the
case, it would confuse cases where a user has a lock and then the
file is changed.  To modify the file, close the server down, make
the changes, and then bring it back up.


E.  Dealing with Multiple Files

The Server can handle an arbitrary number of files.  If you have a
new file that you would like to use, simply put the file where the
server will be able to see it, and then the first time someone
tries to access the file, it will be loaded up.


F.  Setting up the HTML code
 
The applet has three options that can be specified -- "host", which
is used to specify where the server lives, "port", which is the
port to connect to, and "file", which is the file to be accessed.
 
Note:  Due to Netscape security restrictions, any attempt to set
host to anything other than the web server will cause an access
violation.
 
Here is some sample code:
 
<html>
<head>
    </title>DISCOVER</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1><center>Daily Progress Report</center></h1><p>
<h2><center>DISCOVER 4.1</center></h2><p>
<center>
<applet Code="SpreadsheetApplet.class"
        width=680
        height=500>
<PARAM NAME="port" VALUE="4000">
<PARAM NAME="file" VALUE="daily_progress.4.1">
You need a java-enhanced browser to run this applet
</applet>
</center>
</body>
</html>

III.  Frequently Asked Questions


A.  Netscape runs fine, but doesn't load the applet

There are two problems.  If you get the message:

"You need a java-enhanced browser to run this applet"

then you have Java shut off in Netscape.  Go to "Security 
Preferences" under "Options", and then switch to the "Languages"
notebook page.  Make sure Netscape is on.


If Netscape complains that it cannot find a file in the CLASSPATH
variable, then you probably are not including the system .login 
file.  In either your .login or your .cshrc, you should add the
line:

	source /ParaSET/tools/aset.login



B.  I wnat to get a copy of the raw data

In your browser, you can open up the raw page, if the data files
are included as part of the web server files (this is the current
setup).  Go to the page with the name of the file.  Ex:

	http://groucho/daily_progress.4.1


C.  I start up the applet and enter the username, but nothing loads in

The Java Server may not be running.  Make sure that it is started on the web
server machine.


D.  I go to the correct location, but Netscape just sits there; the page never
loads

The Web Server may not be running.  Make sure that it is up.
