<p>
Percolation is the determination of the severity that is
labeled on a message group (including root).
The severity is the maximum of the severities
propagated from any child node, 
but <em>the propagated severity may be different from
the severity of the child</em>.
A configuration file determines how the severity of the
child node is adjusted, prior to factoring it into the
parent's severity. 
This is the spec for the configuration file.
</p>
<p>This spec is embodied in /paraset/src/logpresent/filtersev.C.
It is used in /paraset/src/logpresent/data/filtersev.xml, which is
installed as %CODE_ROVER_HOME%/lib/filtersev.xml.
</p>
<h4>XML Spec</h4>
<p>The element types are:
<ul>
<li>percolate
  <br>Wraps the entire XML file.
  <br>Contains zero or more &lt;group&gt; elements as children.
<li>group
  <br>Contains a &lt;name&gt; element.
  <br>Contains zero or more &lt;filter&gt; elements.
<li>name
  <br>contains text
<li>filter
  <br>a boolean function which filters the children
  <br>indicates conditions,
      each a &lt;messageid&gt;, a &lt;severity&gt;, or a &lt;groupid&gt;.
      Additional conditions make the filter more selective.
  <br>has a sev attribute of "normal", etc. indicating
      the severity to propagate from the selected child
<li>messageid
  <br>contains text
<li>severity
  <br>has val attribute of "normal", etc.
<li>groupid
  <br>contains text
<li>isgroup
</ul>
</p>

<pre>
group ::= name, filter-list
filter ::= severity, condition-list
condition ::= messageid | severity | groupid | isgroup
</pre>

<h4>Meaning of the Severities</h4>
<p>Once a severity value percolates to the
root, it has a meaning as follows:
<table border>
<tr><td><td><th>meaning<th>consequence
<tr><td>normal<td>green<td>Everything is good.<td>Start the model automatically.
<tr><td>warning<td>yellow/green<td>Almost everything is good, i.e. minor parse errors.<td>Start the model automatically.
<tr><td>error<td>red<td>Gross error, e.g. a source module is missing.<td>Can start the model, by explicit user action.
<tr><td>catastrophe<td>xxx<td>Unrecoverable failure to create a model.<td>Don't start model.
