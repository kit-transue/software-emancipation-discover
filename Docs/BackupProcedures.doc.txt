Nightly Backup Procedures
Feb 28, 1994 - revised 3/16/94


Backups are run every weeknight.  The backups are rotated through
a weekly schedule with a separate set of tapes for each night
Monday through Thursday.  Fridays are rotated on a monthly basis
with a set of four tapes.  The last Friday of each month is rotated
on a yearly basis.  There is a pre-printed schedule for the Friday
backups which lists which tape set to use, it is kept on top of the
backup tape drives.

The scripts to run nightly backups live in the directory

	/users/admin/back

The nightly backup script is b.nightly.  That script in turn calls
b.ParaSET and b.users which backup the drives /ParaSET and /users.

	b.ParaSET	backs up  /ParaSET	on /dev/st0
	b.users		backs up  /users	on /dev/st1

The machine for backups is named hellcat and sits directly to the
right-hand side of pragma in the server room.  It has two 8mm tape
drives attached to it. The Dynatek HSB8500 is /dev/st0 and the
Falcon 8200 is /dev/st1.  Note that the actual processing of the
backup script is to be done on pragma, using the tapes as remote
devices.

The backup tapes are kept in the top left drawer of the desk along
the back wall in the server room.

=================================

To perform nightly backups:

1) Check the output from the last backup:  If it succeeded, the
    tapes will be ejected.  But to be sure, you must read the
    mail message from the cron job.

	> rlogin pragma -l root
	# mail

    Look for output from the backup cron job. Verify that it ran
    successfully. Verify that both /ParaSET and /users were backed up.
    Make sure date is current (today) and that the tapes have 
    yesterday's "day" on them.  Each log should end "DUMP IS DONE".


2) Rotate the tapes

    Remove the previous tapes from the tape drives. You might have to
    eject the tape if there was an error.  If the backup was
    successful, mark the date of that backup on the provided label on
    the case for that tape.

	Note: Put the date of the last full day's worth of data
	      that is backed up on the tape. For example: Monday's
	      backups are run early on Tuesday morning, they should
	      get Monday's date, not Tuesday's.

    Friday tape sets should be given to Kim to be kept off-site. Initial
    the Friday backup schedule after dating the tapes and giving them to
    Kim.  On days other than Fridays, put the pair of tapes back into the
    tape drawer.

    On Monday through Thursday, use the weekly tape set for that day.
    On Fridays, consult the log sheet to determine which Friday tape set
    to use.  Put the next set of tapes in, inserting the tape fully, till
    the door closes.   Put "ParaSET" tape into /dev/st0, and "users" into
    /dev/st1.  The drives are also labeled "Paraset" and "Users", but
    when in doubt, trust the drive number.

3) Submit the backup job

	> rlogin progam -l root
	# at -cm midnight /users/admin/back/b.nightly
	# atq

    Look at the output from 'atq' to verify that the job was submitted.

=================================

That's all!
