                               Sketching


    User Interface Requirements:

    1. Palettes, rubberbanding, customization, positioning and straightening, pull and insert text. Single palette for multiple window etc.

    2. Clean abstraction of GUI Toolkit dependency such that Toolkit can be replaced with minimal rewriting.

    3. Provision for extending Toolkit features to allow a customized palette if desired.

    Options:

    a. Select and customize available applications like InterviewsDraw. 

    Advantage: Less work. 

    Disadvantage: Limitations of the toolkit like look and feel, bugs(it's free S/W!) are inherited.

    b. Build X/Motif equivalent. 

    Advantages: Can look better, can be designed to be more customizable. 

    Disadvantage: Lot of work. Is a big project on its own. Will certainly be re-inventing some parts of the wheel if not all.

    c. Build customizable UI from high level building blocks like Unidraw (Interviews).

    Advantages: Less work than (b. Possible to controll look and feel. Can be designed to allow user customization of essential components.
