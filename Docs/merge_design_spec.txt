    Design specification

        1. Design Description

            If the file to be checked in does not have a good pset file, but the system area does have an old pset file, the Put command will do a 2-file merge automatically to create a good pset file.

            If the file has a good pset file, the source file will be checked in first. The source file will be checked out right away to obtain the log message for the source file. It will do the 2-file merge to insert the log message into the pset file. The pset file is ready to be checked in now.

            Because the pset file will obtain its own log message, it will use the "-kk" switch to check out the pset file to suppress the log message for the pset file such that the source file and the pset file will not be out of sync.

            If the source file is newer than the pset file, the Get command will do a 2-file merge automatically.

            If the Load file command finds the pset file is out of sync, a popup dialog box will ask if the user wants to do a 2-file merge.

            When the "ParaSET -batch -u" process is executed, the 2-file merge will be done in the first pass for any file of which its pset file is out of sync.

        2. Internal Architecture

            No new data structure is required. The project for 2-file merge is done. 

            One old field in the file header of the pset file will be updated now. The checksum for the source file was assigned to be 0 which was stored in the file header of the pset file. The shell command "sum" will be used to evaluate the checksum of the source file. In the future, it will not check the time stamp between the source file and the pset file. Instead, the checksum of the source file and the checksum stored in the pset file will be compared.

        3. Touched Areas

            projModule.C -- will be modified for the Get, Put, and Load commands.

            xref.h.C -- will be modified for the "ParaSET -batch -u" process.

            setget -- will be modified for the Get command.

            setput -- will be modified for the Put command.

        4. Detailed Process

            Let's use a.c and a.c.pset as example files.

            4.1. Get

                If there is no pset file in the system area, it will just get the source file.

                If the checksum of the source file and the checksum stored in the pset file are identical, both source file and the pset file will be checked out.

                If the checksums are different, the 2-file merge will be done in the following way.

                4.1.1. check out a.c and a.c.pset.

                4.1.2. rename a.c to a'.c and touch a.c.

                4.1.3. do 2-file merge for a.c and a'.c.

                4.1.4. delete a'.c.

            4.2. Put -- source file with a good pset file

                4.2.1. check in the source file a.c.

                4.2.2. check out the source file a.c.

                4.2.3. do step 4.1.2, 4.1.3, and 4.1.4.

                4.2.4. delete a.c

                4.2.5. check in a.c.pset.

            4.3. Put -- source with no pset file

                If the system does not have any pset file, only the source file will be checked in. Otherwise, the following merge steps will be done automatically.

                4.3.1. check out the pset file a.c.pset.

                4.3.2. do the merge steps as in 4.1.2, 4.1.3, and 4.1.4.

                4.3.3. do all steps in 4.2.

            4.4. Load

                If there is no pset file, raw view will be displayed.

                If the pset file is out of sync, and the user wants a merge, do 4.1.2, 4.1.3, and 4.1.4 and load the good pset file. If the user does not want a merge, raw view will be displayed.

                If the pset file is good, it loads the file into the SMOD view.

            4.5. ParaSET -batch -u

                Do 4.1.2, 4.1.3, and 4.1.4 as a 2-file merge for any file of which its pset file is out of sync.

        5. Issue

            The time stamp checking between the pmod file and both the source file and the pset file should be fixed but it is not scheduled in this project.
