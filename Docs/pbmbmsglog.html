<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of the "log presentation" is to organize
the messages and logs produced by various phases and
processes of model build, to make the information 
available in a useful and rational form.</p>

<p>Currently, most of the model build status and error
information is dumped into a log file, which is
difficult to deal with because:
<ul>
<li>The final status
   of the model build does not really indicate
   whether the model is valid.
   
<li>   Statistical summaries are hard to interpret.

<li>   The log showing the detection of a problem can
   be far removed from the summary which reports
   the failure.

<li>   The detail which the user must deal with is 
   controlled only by the DISCOVER_VERBOSE flag.

<li>  Sometimes it is necessary to  set DISCOVER_VERBOSE
   and start the model build over from the beginning.
</ul>
</p>

<p>"Log presentation" improvement will analyze and provide
structure to the information which currently goes into
the log.  

<ol>
<li>The overall structure is a tree.  When the tree is completely
   collapsed to 1 message (the root), that message gives the
   overall status of the model build.  More information
   is available as subnodes of the root.

<li>Most of the tree's structure is derived from the
   message database.  The database will indicate the
   hierarchy of one process invoking another, such as
   the driver running the parse phase, or the parse
   phase invoking aset_CCcc to parse 1 file.  For a
   given phase there will typically be two levels in
   the tree hierarchy: the terse, qualitative overall
   status, and a summary of progress (e.g. parse statistics).

<li>"Log presentation" will adapt the structure of the message
   database, to highlight overriding aspects of progress.
   For example, the summary of overall model build progress
   would ordinarily be backed up by the results of various
   phases of the model build.  But if the model build ran
   out of disk space, the lack of disk space would show up
   as more important than the phase structure of the model
   build.  

<li>Every node in the structure will have a severity level,
   so that more severe messages can be highlighted to catch
   the eye in the GUI.
   <ul>
    <li>catastrophe: step could not be completed
    <li>error: step complete, but not successful
    <li>warning: potentially related to understanding an error
    <li>normal: step complete and valid
    <li>unknown: unknown severity
   </ul>
<li>"Log presentation" will provide additional analysis of
model build progress.  The ultimate status code will reflect
the whole model build process. 
</ol>
This structure and analysis addresses the log shortcomings as
follows:
<ul>
<li>The final status reflects the whole model build.
<li>Summaries are backed up by contributory details,
in a way that is easy to navigate.
<li>The information which is currently exposed by
DISCOVER_VERBOSE will always be logged, so the
environment variable is no longer used.
<li>The user has direct control over what detail to view.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Fitting It Together</h3>
<p>Improvements to log presentation will take place
in the context of Kit's &amp; Sudha's log creation,
and a GUI front end for the push button model build.
Log presentation is handled by a module which is in between
these two.
<table border>
<tr><td>Model Build / Logger &nbsp; ==> &nbsp; Log Presentation &nbsp; ==> &nbsp; GUI
</table>
Log Presentation will be implemented in C++ as a separate executable.
Its input and ouput will be through sockets/pipes rather than
by physical file, because the model build, the log presentation,
and the GUI must run simultaneously.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Methodology</h3>
<p>Implementing good log presentation will require feedback from
users. Since the goal is to give users the information they
need at the time they are looking for it, we need to focus
on the most common impediments to a successful model build.
I will seek out user experience through in-house QA and through
trials at customer sites, noting what is available in the log
and what information the user needs to see.
This user experience imposes requirements on the log presentation.
I am hopeful that by handling 10 or so different user scenarios well,
we can provide a smooth and pleasant user experience 90% of the time.
</p>
<p>Some enhancements to log presentation will require
better structuring. These can be handled partly in the
log presentation module and partly in the parser driver, by
providing more structure (using more process ids for chunks
of the processing).
Other enhancements will require revising the information going
into the log. And some can be addressed by intelligent
analysis of the log and the build environment.
</p>

<h3>Configurability</h3>
<p>If log presentation needs to detect messages in the
log based on their text, it should use a configuration file
for this purpose, so that it can be readily updated if
the messages should change.
</p>

</h3>
<h3>Communication With Logger</h3>
<p>Messages from the logger include
<ul>
<li>severity
<li>parent id
<li>type of message (see below)
    <ul>
    <li>spawn
    <li>finish
    <li>summary
    <li>other
    </ul>
<li>message body/text
</ul>
The messages will be passed using XML syntax, for example,
<pre>
    &lt;msg sev="normal" parent="95" finish&gt;The model build is done.&lt;/msg&gt;
    &lt;msg sev="catastrophe" parent="127"&gt;
          The file $1 could not be opened.
          &lt;arg num="1"&gt;bleaugh&lt;/arg&gt;&lt;/msg&gt;
    &lt;spawn child="131" parent="95"&gt;C++ Parser&lt;/spawn&gt;
    &lt;msg sev="normal" parent="97" summary&gt;
  ===== Update Summary project /ttt =====
    24 	modules succeeded update
    24 	modules needed update for project /ttt
    0 	modules failed update&lt;/msg&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>In addition, "log presentation" requires the following from
the log maker:
<ol>
<li>All messages from the pbmb-driver and the dismb code which
it invokes must be logged, in addition to messages from aset/pset_server and
the parsers.
<li>When a parser or a model build phase is invoked,
a fresh message group id is assigned to that phase.
This id is referred to as "parent"
by any messages originating during that phase
(except when the phase is refined into more detailed sub-groups).
The assigned ids should not be re-used after a phase
terminates.  (This is to enable the parent to be
identified easily and without possibility of confusion.)
<li>A distinct "spawn" message indicates the relationship
of parent to child group.  It also includes a title
for the child group, suitable for progress/status messages.
<li>A phase may log when it is finished, with an
appropriate severity indicating success or lack thereof.
<li>Messages which provide a summary upon completion of a
phase, a parse, etc. are so identified.
</ol>
</p>
<p>The message bodies passed from logger to presentation
are expected to evolve, to become ASCII message identifiers.
They are taken verbatim from the source code.  
Log presentation  will look them up in a translation table for an appropriate language.
Note that the "Update Summary" example above is <em>not</em>
ready for translation.  It is acceptable right now,
but will need to change eventually.
</p>
<h4>XML Spec</h4>
<p>
There are three elements types.
<ul>
<li>msg
    <br>The msg element is at the top level of the comm stream.
    <br>It may contain arg elements as children.
    <br>Its text is the message, containing parameters such as $2.
    <br>Its attributes are:
    <ul>
    <li>The sev attribute can be "normal", "warning", "error", or "catastrophe".
    <li>The parent attribute is a non-negative integer id, either 0
       or a previously spawned id.
    <li>The finish attribute is optional, with no value.
    <li>The summary attribute is optional, with no value.
    </ul>
<li>arg
    <br>The arg element is a child of a msg element.
    <br>Its text is the value to be substituted.
    <br>Its only attribute is num, which indicates the parameter to substitute for.
<li>spawn
    <br>The spawn element is at the top level of the comm stream.
    <br>Its text is a noun phrase identifying 
        the grouping of subordinate messages.
    <br>Its attributes are:
    <ul>
    <li>The parent attribute is a non-negative integer id, either 0 or
       a previously spawned id.
    <li>The child attribute is a positive integer id for the spawned
        message group.
    </ul>
</ul>
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Communication With GUI</h3>
<p>
Communication from "log presentation" to the Java GUI
consists of (1) the structured log and (2) progress fraction
updates.  Both the progress number and the
structured log are available as soon as the 
push-button-model-build starts.
Dynamic updates are particularly interesting
for the tree-structured log.
</p>
<p>
The messages from "log presentation" to GUI use XML as follows:
<table border>
<tr><th>message type<th>parameters<th>example
<tr><td>progress<td>percent done, title of current phase
    <td>&lt;progress done="24%" title="model build"/&gt;
<tr><td>done (no more progress)<td><td>&lt;done/&gt;
<tr><td>new message (tree) node<td>node id, severity, help id, body/text
    <td>&lt;message node="527" severity="catastrophe" help="259"&gt;Out of memory.&lt;/message&gt;
<tr><td>revise message (tree) node<td>node id, severity, help id, body/text
    <td>&lt;message node="527" severity="catastrophe" help="259"&gt;Out of memory.&lt;/message&gt;
<tr><td>append child<td>parent node id, child node id
    <td>&lt;append node="527" parent="525"/&gt;
<tr><td>prepend child<td>parent node id, child node id
    <td>&lt;prepend node="527" parent="525"/&gt;
<tr><td>append to sibling<td>id of base sibling, id of new sibling
    <td>&lt;append node="527" sibling="526"/&gt;
<tr><td>prepend to sibling<td>id of base sibling, id of new sibling
    <td>&lt;prepend node="527" sibling="526"/&gt;
<tr><td>delete node<td>
    <td>&lt;delete node="527"/&gt;
</table>
With the above definition, it takes 2 commands to add a message to the displayed
log: a "message" which creates the node, and an "append" which
places it within the visible structure.
Yuri persuaded me that with XML, it would be better to use a
single element per action. The following is proposed, but has
not yet been reviewed by Alex Z.
<table border>
<tr><th>action<th>parameters<th>example
<tr><td>progress<td>percent done, title of current phase
    <td>&lt;progress done="24%" title="model build"/&gt;
<tr><td>done (no more progress)<td><td>&lt;done/&gt;
<tr><td>new message<td>node id, severity, help id, position, body/text
    <td>&lt;message node="527" severity="catastrophe" help="259" parent="525"
                    &gt;Out of memory.&lt;/message&gt;
<tr><td>move message to last top-level position<td>node id, position (implicit)
    <td>&lt;move node="527"/&gt;
<tr><td>move message to first top-level position<td>node id, position
    <td>&lt;move node="527" prepend/&gt;
<tr><td>move message to last child of given parent<td>node id, position
    <td>&lt;move node="527" parent="635"/&gt;
<tr><td>move message to first child of given parent<td>node id, position
    <td>&lt;move node="527" parent="635" prepend/&gt;
<tr><td>move message to follow a given sibling<td>node id, position
    <td>&lt;move node="527" sibling="529"/&gt;
<tr><td>move message to precede a given sibling<td>node id, position
    <td>&lt;move node="527" sibling="529" prepend/&gt;
<tr><td>revise message (tree) node<td>node id, any changed parameters, (no position)
    <td>&lt;revise node="527" severity="catastrophe" help="259"&gt;Out of memory.&lt;/message&gt;
<tr><td>delete node and all descendants<td>node id
    <td>&lt;delete node="527"/&gt;
<tr><td>delete all descendants of a node<td>parent node id
    <td>&lt;delete parent="525"/&gt;
</table>
</p>
<p>Notes:
<ul>
<li>The body/text of a message node includes
all relevant details.
When the message is due to a parser, it
includes file name, line, and column indication.
The model build phase is inherent in the
tree structure.
<li>The structural append/prepend/move messages are not intended to
position a node
simultaneously in more than one location of the tree.
They may be applied to a node which already has a
position in the tree, to move it to a new position.
<li>If need arises for a "message id" attribute to support filtering,
it will be easy to add an attribute to the XML.
<li>It was agreed on May 8 that for the time being,
log presentation will avoid sending any "move messagge" directives
to the GUI.
</ul>
</p>
<h3>PBMB Driver</h3>
<p>
Discover will install a push button in MS Visual Studio.
When the user clicks the button, it will invoke
an executable that's part of Discover.
This executable is not the Java GUI, because
Java can't start the other pieces of the 
push-button-model-build.
It is a small coordinator which starts the Java GUI,
and which afterward receives communications from the Java GUI.
</p>
<p>To start the push-button-model-build executable,
MS Visual Studio finds it via the environment variable DIS_PBMB.
It passes one argument, indicating the current project.
(The driver actually needs the pathname of the project's
DSP file, but as far as we know this is not in the public
interface for Visual Studio plug-ins.)
This driver executable
<ul>
<li>Registers its communications socket with the name server.
<li>Starts the Java GUI, supplying as an argument the name of the current Visual Studio project.
<li>Receives communications from the Java GUI (the commands described above).
<li>Starts the Perl model build driver (currently known as <code>parser_driver.pl</code>).
<li>Starts the log presentation process.
</ul>
</p>
<p>Note that having Visual Studio active is not
really important for the pushbutton model build, 
because the user still gets to select the DSP file 
in the Java GUI. 
The driver and the Java GUI should be robust to
start up successfully even if a project name is
not supplied.
</p>
<h3>Java GUI</h3>
<p>The Java GUI sends the following messages (in XML) to the 
push-button-model-build engine.
<table border>
<tr><th>message type<th>description<th>example
<tr><td>Start &amp; Run<td>i.e. start model build and run Code Rover
    <td>&lt;start/&gt;
<tr><td>Build<td>and not start Code Rover
    <td>&lt;build/&gt;
<tr><td>Cancel<td>
    <td>&lt;cancel/&gt;
<tr><td>DSP<td>Set location to find DSP file.
    <td>&lt;dsp&gt;f:\discover\src\discovermdi\discovermdi.dsp&lt;/dsp&gt;
<tr><td>Output<td>Set location on for ADMINDIR &amp; model.
    <td>&lt;output&gt;f:\discover\src\discovermdi\model&lt;/output&gt;
</table>
</p>
<p>The Java GUI can have a visual arrangement such as:
<br>
<img src="pbmbGUI.gif">
<ul>
<li>The "Select DSP" combo box defaults to Visual Studio's 
current project, and might also list projects from
Visual Studio's list of recent projects.
<li>The "Select Output" combo box defaults to the location 
of the DSP file (once a DSP file has been selected).
<li>Each combo box has a "browse..." button.
<li>There's an area for displaying the tree-structured log.
<li>The "Build" and "Run" pushbuttons both initiate a model
build. The "Run" button also starts Code Rover.
<li>A menu item will save the log to a file, using XML.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The GUI supports a command, by which the user
can dump the XML log to a file.  A stylesheet suitable
for viewing the XML log will be supplied with the push-button-model-build.
</p>
<h4>Help</h4>
<p>Clicking on a log message should
pop up a help window describing possible solutions. 
(This is not a first cut feature.)
</p>
<h3>Communications API and XML</h3>
<p>The XML communications API for C++ will be built on
IBM's XML4C.  To send an XML element, it is constructed
by a sequence of member function calls which add the
element tag, attributes, and text.
Upon receiving an XML element, member functions allow
access to the tag and text. Another member function
supports lookup of attributes.
</p>
<p>This API may be based on a portable, template-based
library for strings and containers, or it may be
based on the standard C++ library.
</p>
<p>The use of an industrial strength implementation of
XML will allow for eventual translation of messages
to any language.
</p>

<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>More details of how the logger is embodied, and how it
communicates with the log presentation process.
</p>
<p>Would it make more sense for message translation to
take place in the Java GUI?</p>
<p>It might be preferable to do message translation lookup
and parameter subsititution in the Java GUI.
That way the C++ code of the log presentation need not
be concerned with character sets and Unicode.</p>
