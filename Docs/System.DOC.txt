-----------------------SYSTEM DOCUMENT---------------------------------


	The section that follow are concerned with:
	
	1. Builds
	2. Tests.
	3. Adding users and Systems.
	4. Backups.
	5. Physical media, documentation and installation ares for
	   various software.
        6. Phone number.


1.0 Build related contab entries and scripts:
---------------------------------------------

	The build sequence, build logs, and disk space for builds are described
	below.

	1.1 Build sequence
        ------------------
	- Builds are started from a crontab entry on pragma  for user builder.

	- The calling sequence of scripts on [ machine, user ]  are as shown
          below.
	  (Note that integrate.sh and lockvob.sys below recursively call 
	  themselves):

		/paraset/tools/builder/integrate.cron [ pragma, builder ]	
		           |
			   v
		 /paraset/tools/builder/integrate.sh  [ pragma, builder ]
		    |                           |
		    v                           |
/users/builder/bin/lockvob.sys			|
  |		         |                      |
  |		         |                      |
  v                      |                      |	
  /users/vobadm/lockvob  |                      |--------|
 [pragma, vobadm]        |		        v        v
  			 v	      /paraset/tools/builder/integrate.slave 
/users/builder/bin/lockvob.sys		      [(tweety,loner), builder]
[(tweety,pragma,loner), builder]
				     
	1.2 Build Logs	
	--------------

	- The build logs are in directories under /users/builder/integ
	  and /ParaSET/tools/builder. The log files/directories details 
	  are as follows:

	 1. make_aset log is in directory <machine><Month>-<Date>.<number> 
	    under /users/builder/integ. This directory has a file <ARCH>.
            <ARCH> file has the logfile name in it for detailed build.

	 2. integrate.sh logs are in <Day>.<Month>.<Date>.<numbder>.platform
            under /users/builder/integ.
	   
	 3. log.<Machine>.<Month>.<Date>.95.<Time> under 
	    /ParaSET/tools/builder has information about ALL
	    make_asets run by any user including  builder.

	 4. Reference time info for various versions are listed in
	     /ParaSET/tools/builder/integ_logs/vt_log.

       1.3 Disk space for builds
       -------------------------

	  All the build space required have as their root
	  /net/pragma/pvob/paraset.

	 The build space for various platforms is as follows:

	 Sun4-O: 		xi:/local/makepool 
	 Sun4-g: 		pragma:/compile/makepool
	 Sun5-O and Sun5-g:     tweety:/compile/makepool
	 hp700-O:		loner:/compile
         hp700-g:		pragma:/pvob

	If it becomes necessary to delete some versions of the 
	builds when the disk space runs low, one can find out 
	all the version numbers of builds currently accessed by
	any view by running /users/builder/bin/vtree_show.
	
	Versions that are not accessed by any view can then be deleted.

	1.3 Release to R&D Customer
        ---------------------------
		Release to R&D after a build is installed in install.new.tmp
	on pragma, tweety, or loner for sun4, sun5, and hp700 can be
	made from electra. 
	To release these to all of R&D:
		- log into electra as builder.
		- Get into an atria view(sun4,sun5,or hp700).
		- release.sh <sun4|sun5|hp700>
		
	A customer release can only be made from an already existing
       installation area.Use script /paraset/tools/builder/customer_release.sh.
	  
2. Tests:
---------
		-Demo tests are run from crontab entries for user account 
		  dtest on pragma, tweety, and  loner.

		- Once demo test is complete, this creates a flag under 
		  /users/btest/States.
		
		- crontab entry for btest on pragma,loner, and tweety start
		  regression tests depending on the existence of OK flags
	          under /users/btest/States.
		
		- Regression test results go on {sun4,sun5,hp700} machines
		  under /net/{pragma,tweety,loner}/compile/test_output 
		 respectively.
		- Regression tests use display on a different machine.
                  The DISPLAY for a platform can be found looking inside
                  .cshrc for user btest.
		
		- State of the system can be inspected by running
		  /users/btest/bin/Fill-Table which produces a printed output.

			
3. Adding new Systems:
----------------------
	The patch cables are in the room where the hubs are.

4.  Adding new users:
---------------------

	Password file is /var/yp/passwd ON electra.
	However, when you add a new user, dont just run make but:
	
	make passwd DIR=/var/yp
	
	Better yet, run passwd as root and change password of a user
	to what it currently is. This will automatically update NIS password
	entry correctly.

5. Phyical media and Documentation:
-----------------------------------
	- Most of the CDROMs and media are next to pragma.
	- Autoplan is installed in light:/port/aplan.
	- Oracle is installed in   electra:/home
	- The physical documentation are either in the library area
	  or in the Steel Cupboard next to aharlap.
	- The 8mm tapes are in my desk on the 2 and third drawers on 
	  left.
	- The "Hardware" such as screw drivers are either in the cupboard
	  or the steelcase next to aharlap.


6. Backups:
-----------
	- Source is backed up on tape from pragma from a crontab entry for root.
	- Source is also saved in text format outside vob under under 
          /net/tweety/pools++/src-backup everyday.
	- All the individual user views are backed up from a cron entry 
	  for builder on tweety under /net/tweety/export/home/ViewSave.
	- Since there is a symbolic link /users/ViewSave to /net/tweety/export/
          home/ViewSave, the views are automatically backed up tape also.
        - The Daily backup media are on the tape drive above pragma. Someone
	  needs to change the media every day.
	- Weekend media can be taken out of my desk.
