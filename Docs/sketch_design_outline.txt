                                   Sketching


    Problem Domain:

    I. Graphics Toolkit specific:

        1. Palettes, rubberbanding, customization, positioning and straightening, pull and insert text. Single palette for multiple window etc. 

        2. Clean abstraction of Toolkit dependency such that Toolkit can be replaced with minimal rewriting. 

        3. Provision for extending Toolkit features to allow a customized palette if desired.

    II. Design specific:

        1. View a Sketch as a container object holding certain components, entities or subassembly where, entity - graphical visualization of a pmod entity. component - an arbitrary collection of entities. subassembly - an arbitrary set of components or subassemblies. 

        2. High level abstraction entities, components and subassemblies. 

        a. A component can be 'soft associated' to other elements like docs, other sketches, source code etc.

        b. A component is customizable, but not an entity. 

        c. Each entity has a predefined visual representation which can be customized/changed. 

        d. A component may have predefined visual rep.

        3. Each sketch is an instance of a 'Sketch Application' such that multiple 'Sketches' are allowed to exist for a single pmod. 

    III. Others:

        1. Storage/Retrieval. 

        a. Regeneration as opposed to others like Bitmap storage. 

        b. Advantages/Disadvantages of Regeneration. 

        c. Issues involved in each regeneration - integrity check, use of predefined images. Work involved in each regeneration must be minimized. Consistency and completeness check.
