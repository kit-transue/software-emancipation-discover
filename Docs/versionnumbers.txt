Locations of Version Numbers in Discover

1) NT Installations

They are usually near the top.

These live in n:\nt-bin\installshield\server\setup.rul, n:\nt-bin\installshield\client\setup.rul

Please be extremely careful with the client installation, as our version numbers tend to track Developer Studio's fairly well--edit the file manually (don't use sed).

2) /paraset/admin/version and /paraset/admin/market_version.

3) splash screen:
	Check in the new versions of splash.xpm and splash.psd in 
	/paraset/data/images.  Read README.TXT in that directory for
	advice about the images.
