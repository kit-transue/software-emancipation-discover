<p><b>Securty - Don't depend on Package Scope.</b></p>

<p>Package-level access is not secure enough for security.  Java packages are
not closed (meaning that new elements can be added to them, even at program
runtime). As a result, an attacker can potentially introduce a new class
inside your packages and use this new class to access the things you thought
you hide.</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b>
Do not rely on package-level access.  Make your class, method, field to have
least access as possible.</p>
