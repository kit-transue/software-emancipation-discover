<p><b>DNTEFNP - Do Not throw Exceptions for Normal Processing</b></p>

<p>Throwing an exception is costly and should be reserved for exceptional situations. Something that you
expect to happen normally during execution of your code is <i>not exceptional</i>. For example, if you are writing
 validation rules that either pass or fail, you should not generate an exception on your rule failure. Control anything 
 you can directly with code. Exceptions are designed to handle situations for which you cannot possibly code.</p>
