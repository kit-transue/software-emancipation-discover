<!-- EJB_SFACT - Don't set the socket factory -->
<p>According to Sun EJB specifications, the enterprise bean must not attempt to set the socket factory used by ServerSocket, Socket, or the stream handler factory used by URL.</p>
<p><i>These networking functions are reserved for the EJB Container. Allowing the enterprise bean to use these functions could compromise security and decrease the Container's ability to properly manage the runtime environment.</i></p>
