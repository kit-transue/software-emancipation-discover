<p><b>Securty - Make Your Class Unserializable</b></p>

<p>Java's serialization mechanism lets the programmer save entire objects to a
storage mechanism such as a disc, database, or string. The mechanism also
lets classes be restored from saved information later, perhaps from the same
application after it has stopped and restarted or from another application.
Saving an object's state in Java is serialization; restoring its state is
deserialization.  Serialization is dangerous because it lets adversaries
access your objects' internal state. Adversaries can serialize one of your
objects into a byte array that can be read, which lets them inspect your
object's full internal state, including any fields you marked private and
the internal state of any objects your reference.</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b>
Do not make your classes Serializable if possible.
If you make your classes Serializable, make sure that any sensitive data
members are <i>transient</i>.</p>
