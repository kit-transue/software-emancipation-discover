<!-- EJB_CL - Don't create a class loader -->
<p>According to Sun EJB specifications, the enterprise bean must not attempt to create a class loader; obtain the current class loader; set the context class loader; set security manager; create a new security manager; stop the JVM; or change the input, output, and error streams.</p>
<p><i>These functions are reserved for the EJB Container. Allowing the enterprise bean to use these functions could compromise security and decrease the Container's ability to properly manage the runtime environment.</i></p>
