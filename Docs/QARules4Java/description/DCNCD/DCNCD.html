<p><b>DCNCD - Don't Code Numerical Constants Directly</b></p>

<p>
According to Sun Code Conventions for Java, 
numerical constants (literals) should not be coded directly,
except for -1, 0, and 1, which can appear in a for loop as counter values. 
</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b>
Add static final attributes for numeric constants.
