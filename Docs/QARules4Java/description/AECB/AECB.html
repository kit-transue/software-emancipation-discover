<p><b>AECB - Avoid Empty Catch Blocks</b></p>

<p>
Catch blocks should not be empty.
Programmers frequently forget to process negative outcomes of a program
and tend to focus more on the positive outcomes.
</p>

<p>
When 'Check parameter usage' option is on, this rule also checks, whether
code does something with the exception parameter or not. If not, violation is raised.
</p>

<p>
You can also specify the list of exceptions, which should be ignored.
For example, for <code>PropertyVetoException</code> catch block
usually is empty - as a rule, the program just does nothing if this exception occurs.
