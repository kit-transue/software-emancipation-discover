<p><b>Servlet API - Release JDBC resources when finished.</b></p>

<p>Failing to close and release JDBC connections can cause other users to
experience long waits for connections.  Although a JDBC connection that is
left unclosed will be reaped and returned by application server
after a timeout period, others may have to wait for this to occur.</p>
<p>Close JDBC statements when you are through with them.  JDBC <i>java.jdbc.ResultSets</i> can be
explicitly closed as well.  If not explicitly closed, <i>java.jdbc.ResultSets</i> are released
when their associated statements are closed.</p>

<B>Example</B>

<p><code><nobr>
package com.swemancipation.servlet;<br>
<br>
import java.sql.*;<br>
<br>
public class DemoJdbcResourceRelease {<br>
&nbsp; void testOper () {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Connection conn = null;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Statement stmt = null;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ResultSet rs = null;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; try {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; conn = DriverManager.getConnection ("some url");<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stmt = conn.createStatement();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rs = stmt.executeQuery ("some query");<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; } catch (Exception e) {}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; finally {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; try {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // should have rs.close () and stmt.close ()<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } catch (Exception e) {}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; }<br>
}
</code></nobr></p>

<p><b>Tip:</b>
Ensure that your code is sturctured to close and release JDBC resources in all
cases, even in exception and error conditions.</p>
