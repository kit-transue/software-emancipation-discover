<p><b>ICOMM - Inaccessible Constructor Or Method Matches</b></p>

<p>Overload resolution only considers constructors and methods are visible at the point
of the call. If however, all the constructors and methods were considered, there may
be more matches. This rule is violated in this case.</p>

<p>
Imagine that ClassB is in a different package than ClassA.
Then the allocation of ClassB violates this rule since the
second constructor is not visible at the point of the allocation,
but it still matches the allocation (based on signature).
Also the call to oper in ClassB violates this rule since the second
and the third declarations of oper is not visible at the point
of the call, but it still matches the call (based on signature).

<p><b>Wrong</b></p>

<p><code><nobr>
public class ClassA {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; public ClassA (int param) {}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color='red'>ClassA (char param) {} </font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color='red'>ClassA (short param) {} </font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; public void oper (int param) {}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color='red'>void oper (char param) {} </font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color='red'>void oper (short param) {} </font><br>
}
</code></p></nobr>

<p><b>Tip:</b>
Either give such methods or constructors equal visibility or change their signature.
</p>

<p><b>Right</b></p>

<p><code><nobr>
public class ClassA {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ClassA (int param) {}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color='blue'>public</font> ClassA (char param) {} <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color='blue'>public</font> ClassA (short param) {} <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; public void oper (int param) {}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; void <font color='blue'>doOper</font> (char param) {} <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; void <font color='blue'>doOper</font> (short param) {} <br>
}
