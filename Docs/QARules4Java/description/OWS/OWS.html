<p><b>OWS - Overloading Within a Subclass</b></p>

<p>A superclass method may not be overloaded within a subclass unless
all overloadings in the superclass are also overridden in the subclass.
It is very unusual for a subclass to be overloading methods in its
superclass without also overriding the methods it is overloading. More
frequently this happens due to inconsistent changes between the superclass
and subclass - i.e. the intention of the user is to override the method in
the superclass, but due to the error, the subclass method ends up overloading
the superclass method.</p>

<p><b>Wrong</b></p>

<p><code><nobr>
public class Monkey extends Animal {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color='red'>public void oper (char c) {} </font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; public void oper (Object o) {} <br>
}<br>
class Animal {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; public void oper (int i) {}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; public void oper (Object o) {}<br>
}
</code></p></nobr>

<p><b>Tip:</b>
Overload other methods too.
</p>

<p><b>Right</b></p>

<p><code><nobr>
public class Monkey extends Animal {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; public void oper (char c) {} <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color='blue'>public void oper (int i) {}</font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; public void oper (Object o) {}<br>
}<br>
class Animal {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; public void oper (int i) {}<br>
}
</code></p></nobr>
