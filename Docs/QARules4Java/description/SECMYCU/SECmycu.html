<p><b>Securty - Make Your Class Uncloneable</b></p>

<p>Java's object cloning mechanism lets the programmer make exact duplicates of
objects that have already been instantiated in a running program.  This can let
an attacker manufacture new instances of classes you define, without executing
any of your constructors.  If your class is not cloneable, the attacker can
define a subclass of your class and make the subclass implement java.lang.Clonea
ble.
This lets the attacker make new instances of your class by copying the memory
images of existing objects.  This is often an unacceptable way to make a new
object.</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b>
If you want your class to be cloneable, you can protect yourself by defining a
clone method and making it final.  If you're relying on a non-final clone method
in one of your super classes, then override the method to make it final or make
your entire class final.</p>
