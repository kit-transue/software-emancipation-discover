<!-- EJB_REFL - Don't use Reflection. -->
<p>According to Sun EJB specifications, the enterprise bean must not attempt to query a class to obtain information about declared
members that are not otherwise accessible to the enterprise bean because of the security rules of the Java language. The enterprise bean must not attempt to use the Reflection API to access information that the security rules of the Java programming language make unavailable.</p>
<p><i>This function is reserved for the EJB Container. Allowing the enterprise bean to load native code would create a security hole.</i></p>
