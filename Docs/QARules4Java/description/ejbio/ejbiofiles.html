<!-- EJB_FILES - Access files and directories is restricted -->
<p>According to Sun EJB specifications, an enterprise bean must not use the java.io package to attempt to access files and directories in the file system. </p>
<p><i>The file system APIs are not well-suited for business components to access data. Business components should use a resource manager API, such as JDBC API, to store data.</i></p>
