<p><b>Securty - Don't compare classes by name.</b></p>

<p>Sometimes you want to compare the classes of two objects to see whether they
are the same or whether an object has a particular class.  When you do this,
you must be aware that there can be multiple classes with the same name in a
JVM.</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b>
A better way is to compare class objects for equality directly.</p>
