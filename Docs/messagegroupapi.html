<!--
Every message contains a parent ID.
Every program receives a parent ID as a parameter.
Every program receives a log presentation service name.
Messages which might have children must have an ID indicated, to be matched by log presentation.

<p>A message group shows up in the Pushbutton Model Build GUI as a
set of messages all having the same parent.  Where does this structure
come from?  We don't indicate a message group explicitly everywhere
that a line of code selects a message for output.  Instead, the
call which outputs a message implicitly places it within the current
message group.
</p> 

<p>The current message group is a global variable which is controlled
in a structured way.  Generally, messages are grouped by the sequence
in which they are emitted.  The GUI displays messages in a tree structure,
for example
<pre>
     O Messages
     |
     +--O Specified command line options
     |
      --O Running scandsp
     |
     ---O env
        |
         --O PSETHOME=C:/DISCOVER 
        |
         --O ADMINDIR=N:/nt-bin/parsercmd/Model
</pre>
If the user browses this tree from top to bottom, the messages will
be viewed in the order in which they were emitted.  Note that in the
above example, the message groups are "Specified command line options"
and "env", while "Running scandsp" appears not to be a message group
because no children are indicated.
</p>

<p>Within code that's part of the model build, the most common scenario
requiring a new message group will be for the duration of a local
section of code (and for its calls to other functions).  This might
have been handled with a matching pair of functions 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>pushNewMessageGroup</code>
<br>and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>popMessageGroup</code>
<br>in fact that's how it's done in Perl.  C++ has a more convenient
idiom for the same thing, using a constructor and destructor.
There's an AutoMessageGroup class, 
<pre>
    class AutoMessageGroup {
        AutoMessageGroup(const char *name);
        virtual ~AutoMessageGroup();
    };
</pre>
The constructor for AutoMessageGroup creates the object and sets the
current message group to indicate the new object. 
Its name appears in the GUI as the parent node for
all subsequent messages in the group.
The destructor
restores the current message group to its former object.  So to generate
messages for the tree shown above, the model build program need only
declare two local objects of type AutoMessageGroup.  If needed, a
local block can be introduced just for the local object.
<pre>
    {
        AutoMessageGroup mg("Specified command line options");
        iterator it;
        for (it = clopts.begin(); it != clopts.end(); it++) {
           *pi.dump();
        }
    }
    run_scandsp();
    dump_env();
...
void dump_env()
{
    AutoMessageGroup mg("env");
    for (;;) {
    ...
    msg("$1=$2") &lt;&lt; var_name &lt;&lt; eoarg &lt;&lt; var_value &lt;&lt; eoarg &lt;&lt; eom;
    ...
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<hr>
<p>When a program first starts up, where in the GUI's message tree do the program's messages go?  Most programs, such as aset_CCcc or
pset_server, are started while the model build is already in
progress and their messages need to fit into a location which
relates to the script which invokes them.  Each program must
be able to report its messages in terms of how they fit in.
To support this, each program takes a command line option
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>-messagegroup &lt;string&gt;</code>
<br>in which the string is a code which conveys the necessary information.
Once the command line arguments are analyzed, and prior to
issuing any ordinary messages, the program calls
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>static AutoMessageGroup::init(const char *message_group);</code>
<br>passing the string from the command line.
</p>
<p>Corresponding to this receiver of a message group id string,
is the generator.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>static const char *AutoMessageGroup::current();</code>
<br>This can be used to pass the message group when calling exec
on a program, for example
<pre>
void run_scandsp()
{
    exec("scandsp",
         "-messagegroup", AutoMessageGroup::current(),
    	 dspFileName);
}
</pre>
Note that the id string is passed to identify the message group's
<em>location</em>, and therefore will be distinct from
the visible name in the GUI.

dismb_msg::push_new_message_group(name)
dismb_msg::pop_new_message_group()
dismb_msg::init_auto_message_group(string)
dismb_msg::current_auto_message_group() returns string
