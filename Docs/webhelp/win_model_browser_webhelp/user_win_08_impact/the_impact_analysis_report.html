<p class="p1"><b>The Impact Analysis Report</b></p>
<p class="p2">When you are finished experimenting with source code changes, the <br>
DIScover Impact Analysis Report captures the results in writing. When printed, the resulting document is appropriate and useful for code review or change specification meetings. It illustrates the details of proposed change tasks—which references to change, which entities to modify, and which files to recompile.</p>
<p class="p2">DIScover’s Impact Analysis Reports are useful when you:</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>report to management</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>develop your work schedule</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>estimate the time you need to complete your work</p>
<p class="p2">The Impact Analysis Report is a comprehensive document that details proposed changes as well as the affected entities and files. The report includes three main sections:</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>The header displays the title and date. You can customize this section with your name or other information specific to the report, such as the project name or the release date.

<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>The change specification states the name of the entity that will be changed and the proposed changes.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>The impact description details the changes proposed for each entity, including a list of affected entities and files that need to be recompiled after changes are made.</p>
