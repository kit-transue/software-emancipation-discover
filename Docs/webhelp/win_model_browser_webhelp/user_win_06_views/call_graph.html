<p class="p1"><b>Call Graph</b></p>
<p class="p2">A <i>Call Graph</i> displays the paths (call dependencies) between two functions. Call graphs are useful for debugging or navigating through complex source code and header files. Using graphs, you can improve your comprehension of the possible traces between two functions.</p>
<p class="p2">A call graph uses the information model to track all possible paths between two functions. Unlike Call Tree Diagrams, which show specific, immediate paths from a given entity, a graph lets you take a set of functions and determine what, if any, paths exist between them.</p>
<p class="p2">This is especially useful when you are trying to comprehend the relations between a specific set of functions. For example, if, between two functions in a debugging session your software behaves inappropriately, you can use a graph to plot all paths the software can take. You might know of only one path, but a call graph shows all others.</p>
<p class="p2">A call graph, in conjunction with transitive closure, provides a comprehensive course between two functions. Impact Analysis can tell you that a change affects an entity, and <i>transitive closure</i> shows you that a there is a relationship between two functions, but a graph shows every function in the call path between two functions.</p>
<p class="p2">A graph works by taking a selection of functions from the Browser and sending them to the <b>Graph</b> dialog box. In the <b>Graph</b> dialog box, you construct a function query. If your query contains one or more valid paths between two or more functions, DIScover builds a Graph view or an ASCII report, depending on your choice of output. DIScover informs you that it could not build a graph using the selected functions in the event of missing or incomplete data.</p>
