<p class="p1"><b>Launching Your Integrated IDE</b></p>
<p class="p2">DIScover integrates with several IDEs. Microsoft Visual Studio and Borland JBuilder offer direct integration with DIScover through a shared macro toolbar. Emacs offers integration with DIScover menu bar options.</p>
<p class="p2">At any time, you can launch your IDE by double-clicking a selected entity. DIScover opens your default IDE with the source file containing the selected entity. The line of source that contains the entity appears highlighted for instant identification.</p>
<p class="p2">If you have both your IDE and DIScover open at the same time, you can use the integrated menus and toolbars to toggle back and forth between the two. The features and instructions for these operations vary for each IDE, but the concepts are the same.</p>
<p class="p2">You can use the combination of the tools to do the following:</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>identify entities and their descriptions, use, and function within your source code</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>make direct edits to identified entities and files</p>
