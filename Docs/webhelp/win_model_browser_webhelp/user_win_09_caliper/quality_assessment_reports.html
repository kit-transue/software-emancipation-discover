<p class="p1"><b>Quality Assessment Reports</b></p>
<p class="p2">Caliper generates QARs, to provide quantitative information in both graphical and tabular format about the structure and compliance of a code base against a series of predefined ANSI and industry accepted programming rules, plus a list of non-compliant instances for review and remediation. QARs provide you with detailed information about the modules you run quality filter sets on.</p>
<p class="p2">The report is generated and stored in HTML format for easy viewing and portability. You can customize it with header information such as the engineering project title, quality manager, model version, and so on.</p>
<p class="p2">QARs contain the following:</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>the modules you ran queries on and an overview of the entities contained within those modules</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>graphs displaying the quality breakdown both by filter set and within each filter set</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>the weight, quality score, and number of violations found for each query</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>a description of each filter set</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>a description of each query, including programming examples where applicable</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>a statistical metrics analysis that does not contribute to the total quality score</p>
<p class="p2">To view the QAR online for your currently selected file or project, click the <b>Report</b> tab at the bottom of the Caliper left pane window. You may want to widen the right pane window to view the entire width of the report.</p>
