<p class="p1"><b>Quality Rule Queries</b></p>
<p class="p2">Caliper examines source code using a robust set of over 140 predefined quality rules (queries) that enforce software industry programming standards. These rules are implemented using a unique pattern matching technology that searches for a pattern in the code’s abstract syntax tree. You can switch these rules on or off and set weights that represent an item’s relative importance to your coding standards.</p>
<p class="p2">These quality rule queries can be grouped into the following categories:</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Java </b>are rules specifically applied to Java programming.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>General Programming Standards</b> are rules that search for common programming errors.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Portability</b> are rules that measure the ability of your software to port from one platform to another (for example, from UNIX to Windows).</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Globalization</b> are rules that search for occurrences that measure your software’s support of international character sets and operating systems.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Structure</b> are rules that measure your software project’s compliance with industry standards against a set of metric thresholds.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Test Coverage</b> are rules that measure the efficacy of your testing procedures by determining your level of test coverage.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Statistics</b> are rules that provide statistical counts on entities and determinations of metrics.</p>
<p class="p2">Caliper analyzes new source code against a series of predefined ANSI and industry-accepted programming rules prior to submission to assure compliance with these standards. Once non-compliant instances are identified, the correction of these errors is facilitated by providing an easy method of viewing the violations where they occur in your source and editing them for repair.</p>
<p class="p2">Caliper allows you to save settings, sets of queries, and hit results in <i>sessions</i> that can be reviewed by multiple members of a team. Sessions can store instructions for how a quality analysis is performed, including which queries are executed, which files are analyzed, and what query property values are used.</p>
<p class="p2">Sessions define <b><i>Q</i></b><i>uality </i><b><i>F</i></b><i>ilter </i><b><i>S</i></b><i>ets</i>, or QFS, that Caliper runs on your source code. QFS are a collection of weighted filters used to access a particular aspect of development. QFS can be run on projects and files, and can contain subsets and queries. QFS are based on the Tree Pattern Matching (TPM) technology. In addition, sessions maintain hit results from the applied QFS.</p>
