<p class="p1"><b>Using the Runtime List</b></p>
<p class="p2">Every time you generate results in the runtime list, Developer Xpress stores both the contents of the list and the selection those results were generated from.</p>
<p class="p2">Suppose that you navigate down a branch of the project hierarchy by double-clicking the directories <span class="s1">proj</span>, <span class="s1">subproj</span>, and <span class="s1">foodir</span> in the project hierarchy. As a result, the runtime list displays a list of files containing <span class="s2">foo1.C</span> through <span class="s2">foo36.C</span>. Developer Xpress stores the three directories in one buffer and the list of 36 files in another.</p>
<p class="p2">You can view the record of your navigation by clicking <b>History</b> in the toolbar. Developer Xpress displays the three directories in the runtime list, with the most recent selection at the top of the list.</p>
<p class="p2">Developer Xpress adds each set of results (including History results) to a separate buffer. You can navigate through the contents of this buffer by clicking <b>Back</b> or <b>Forward</b> in the toolbar.</p>
<p class="p2">This buffer wraps from one end to the other as you move back and forward.</p>
