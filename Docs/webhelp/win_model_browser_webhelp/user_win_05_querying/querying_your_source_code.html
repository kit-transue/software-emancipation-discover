<p class="p1"><b>Querying Your Source Code</b></p>
<p class="p2">DIScover queries are divided into five basic areas of knowledge about your source code:</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Where</b> queries find where an entity is referenced, included, or declared. For example, you can use a <b>Where Included</b> query to display the file that includes a selected header file.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Uses</b> queries identify the other entity types a selected entity uses. For example, you can use a <b>Uses Classes</b> query to display the classes used by a selected function.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Defines</b> queries find the other entity types a selected entity defines. For example, you can use a general <b>Defines</b> query to illustrate all the entities defined in a selected file.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Show</b> queries display information about a selected entity, including where it appears in your source code, its nested structures, members, friends, and so on. For example, you can use a <b>Show Instances</b> query to discover all the places in your source code that a selected macro appears.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Declares</b> queries find where and what is declared in a selected entity. For example, you can use a general <b>Declares</b> query to illustrate all of the declarations that appear in a selected header file.</p>
<p class="p2">The list of available queries in the <b>Queries</b> pane of the model browser changes to reflect only those queries that are relevant to the combination of items you select in the <b>Categories</b> pane and Results window.</p>
<p class="p2">Within each relevant query set, queries exist for each language: C, C++, and Java, so you can choose the query that is appropriate for your selected file or entity. The structure of these queries varies slightly to accommodate the differences in languages. If you select the wrong query for your language, DIScover displays an error message.</p>
<p class="p2">Each of these queries is powerful by itself, but becomes more powerful when combined as a series of questions aimed at finding an answer to something specific about your source code.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Important: </b>The model build process converts all file names in the model to lowercase. This does not affect your source files.</p>
