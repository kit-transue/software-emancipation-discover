<p class="p2">Access provides a facility for manipulating DIScover groupsâ€”those named collections accessible from the group manager and other components of the user interface. Like Access sets, groups can contain multiple elements. Groups can be passed to Access procedures, and can be the object of set operations; in both cases, they are automatically converted into Access sets. Unlike sets, they are named. Also unlike sets, they are not reference counted, but continue to exist until they are deleted or until session in which they are created ends. Groups created using Access appear in the Group Manager, and may be saved permanently (either using the Group Manager or using an Access command).</p>
