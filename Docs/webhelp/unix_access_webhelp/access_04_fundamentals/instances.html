<p class="p1"><b>Instances</b></p>
<p class="p2">Most symbols appear more than once in the source: a function that is defined in one source file may be declared in one or more header files, and is called from other functions, and may even be called multiple times from one function. Each appearance of a symbol is an <span class="s1"><i>instance</i></span>.</p>
<p class="p2">The connection between symbol and instance is one way: an instance represents only a region of the source text; it does not refer back to the symbol it spans. For this reason, you cannot query for attributes or relations for an instance. Instances are primarily used to help the user navigate to a particular place in the source.</p>
<p class="p2">Under some conditions, it is possible to convert an instance into a node in the Abstract Syntax Tree (see the following book).</p>
