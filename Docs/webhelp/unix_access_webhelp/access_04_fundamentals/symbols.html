<p class="p1"><b>Symbols</b></p>
<p class="p2"><i>Symbols</i> are the primary keys to the elements in the DIScover model; they are the handle to objects that make up the macro structure of programs: files, functions, macros, typedefs, and so on. In practical terms, symbols are those things that show up in the <b>Categories</b> column of the Browser: files, functions, classes, and so on. A given symbol may appear in multiple places in the model: a function has a definition, may have multiple declarations, and may be called or otherwise referenced in numerous places in the code. All these occurrences are references to the same symbol. Symbols represent logical thingsâ€”they may be most closely associated with a particular piece of source (their definition, for example), but they are not created by the source code.</p>
<p class="p2">For elements with non-local scope (macros, functions, global variables, and so on), DIScover creates separate symbols for objects with the same name. For instance, your model may have two functions named <span class="s1">main</span>. Each instance of <span class="s1">main</span> is given its own symbol and shows up separately in the Browser, in the <b>Elements</b> column.</p>
<p class="p2">Elements with local scope are consolidated as much as possible without losing type information: all string literals, <span class="s1">%s\n</span>, are assigned to the same symbol. For local variables, variables with the same name and type are assembled into the same symbol: there is one symbol for <span class="s1">int i</span>, another for <span class="s1">float i</span>, a third for <span class="s1">long i</span>, and so on, no matter how many occurrences of <span class="s1">int i</span>, for example, actually exist in the source.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Note: </b>Symbols and their relations to the rest of the model are indexed in <span class="s2">pmods</span>. This improves the efficiency of queries involving symbols when they are run against an entire model.</p>
