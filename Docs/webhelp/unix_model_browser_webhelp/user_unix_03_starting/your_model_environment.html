<p class="p1"><b>Your Model Environment</b></p>
<p class="p2">Before you begin using DIScover, it is important for you to understand how your administrator set up the model environment, including which models are available on what servers.</p>
<p class="p2">The frequency that models are built with often reflects your development cycle and build schedule. For this reason, there may be many versions of information models available at one time. We recommend that you understand model naming and version schema so that you connect to the model that is most appropriate for your work.</p>
<p class="p2">A model server supports numerous sessions and clients. You can open the model you want to browse with the model browser, the lightweight command-line based Developer Xpress client, or the Access command-line interface.</p>
<p class="p2">The remainder of this book focuses on using the model browser; more information on Developer Xpress is presented in <a href="../user_unix_appa_devxpress/developer_xpress1.html#XREF_CM_Interface"><span class="s1">Developer Xpress</span></a> and Access is presented in and the <i>DIScover Access Online Help</i>.</p>
