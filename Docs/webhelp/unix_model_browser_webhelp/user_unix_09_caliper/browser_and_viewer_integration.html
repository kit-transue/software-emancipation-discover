<p class="p1"><b>Browser and Viewer Integration</b></p>
<p class="p2">You can access Caliper by selecting <b>Tools &gt; Caliper</b> in the Browser. This opens a Caliper session in which you can view the results of quality filter sets run on a body of source code. You can set the scope of your session by first making a selection in the Browser or Group Manager window, or make no selections at all and set the scope in a blank session. The session allows you to view valuable information about your source code, generate QARs, examine hits, and repair violations.</p>
<p class="p2">Caliper analyzes new source code against a series of predefined ANSI and industry-accepted programming rules prior to submission to assure compliance with these standards. Once you identify non-compliant instances, you can easily evaluate and correct these errors by importing them into a Viewer window. The Viewer displays the source code, with the hit highlighted, for your review and editing.</p>
<p class="p2">Caliper operates on the application of <b><i>Q</i></b><i>uality </i><b><i>F</i></b><i>ilter </i><b><i>S</i></b><i>ets</i>, or QFS, against your source code. QFS are a collection of weighted filters used to access a particular aspect of development. QFS can be run against projects and files, and can contain subsets and queries. QFS are based on the Tree Pattern Matching (TPM) technology afforded through Access.</p>
