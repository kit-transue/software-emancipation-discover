<p class="p2">Caliper analysis stores results in group format in the same way that you store collections of files or entities via the Browser or Group Manager. DIScover saves groups to directories specified in the group path of the preferences file; this provides optimum flexibility for your organization in the availability of regular quality data. Caliper results can be stored in a centralized location for all team members to access or review. This eliminates the need to run Caliper analyses at the individual desktop (which, depending on the scope of your analysis, can be lengthy), while affording you the ability to review all the quality data available.</p>
<p class="p2">While you are still free to perform your own desktop Caliper analysis, your organization may choose to develop a policy in which your DIScover administrator runs a complete Caliper analysis through a weekly <span class="s1">cron</span> job. The results can be stored as a session that is accessible to all team members or perhaps distributed as excerpts from the QAR, depending on the needs of your development team. Your administrator can inform you of your organizationâ€™s group storage policy and quality management practices.</p>
