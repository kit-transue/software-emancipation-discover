<p class="p1"><b>Query Scores</b></p>
<p class="p2">Caliper queries are collections of standards run against your code; these can be predefined, such as the Global and Localization queries included in DIScover, or custom queries that you build yourself. When you run a set of queries, Caliper generates a quality score for each query. When you select a query, its score appears in the <b>Score</b> property box in the right pane of the Caliper window. A query’s score is based on the number of violations found, divided by the total number of possible violations. This is the query’s raw score, represented by the following equation:</p>
<p class="p3">RS<span class="s1">q</span> = H/T</p>
<p class="p2">To generate the visual score for a query, the raw score of that query is multiplied by a scaling constant. The scaling constant has a value of 3; this is based on the supposition that if a third of your code is severely error-ridden, it probably needs a significant amount of remediation. The scaling constant is represented by the following equation:</p>
<p class="p3">SC = 3</p>
<p class="p2">The product of the raw score and the scaling constant is then subtracted from 1. (This is for inversion; the higher <span class="s2">RS</span><span class="s3">q</span> is, the lower the quality score.) Finally, the difference is multiplied by 100 to produce the visual score. The visual score for a query is represented by the following equation:</p>
<p class="p3">VS<span class="s1">q</span> = (1 - (RS<span class="s1">q</span> * SC)) * 100</p>
