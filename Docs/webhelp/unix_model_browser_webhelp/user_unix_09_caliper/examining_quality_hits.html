<p class="p1"><b>Examining Quality Hits</b></p>
<p class="p2">When the queries have finished processing, you can view the results. For each query, Caliper displays the total number of hits in the <b>Instances</b> box. Because hits do not apply to filter sets, the <b>Instances</b> field displays <span class="s1">N/A</span> when a filter set is selected.</p>
<p class="p2">Hits are those instances in your source that have been found to exceed threshold values set forth in the query definition (see <a href="../user_unix_09_caliper/editing_threshold_queries.html#XREF_Threshold_Queries"><span class="s2">Editing Threshold Queries</span></a>). Not every hit is an actual coding violation, as what constitutes a violation can only be determined by your individual organization. However, it is good practice to investigate each hit thoroughly to examine its importance and create a strategy for fixing it, if necessary.</p>
<p class="p2">While reviewing Caliper analysis results, you can easily set attributes for individual hits. This gives you the ability to catalog your hits and perform remediation of those issues you determine to be coding violations.</p>
