<p class="p1"><b>What Is Caliper?</b></p>
<p class="p2"><i>Caliper</i> is an analysis and reporting tool for C, C++, and Java programming projects. Caliper applies a series of predefined ANSI and industry accepted programming rules and metrics to produce a <b><i>Q</i></b><i>uality </i><b><i>A</i></b><i>ssessment </i><b><i>R</i></b><i>eport</i>, or QAR. The QAR provides quantitative information in both graphical and textual forms about the structure and compliance of a software development project to these rules, plus a list of non-compliant instances for review and remediation. You can then examine and repair violations using the model browser with your IDE of choice.</p>
<p class="p2">Caliper performs an analysis on a body of source code and automatically produces a QAR. Graphs and numerical data in the QAR provide a quality score that can be used to track the project as it evolves through the development process to other projects and/or industry benchmark studies. The built-in difference calculator provides a means to compare one QAR against another to identify variations in code quality.</p>
<p class="p2">The QAR also displays a list of rule violations for further investigation. You can assign violations specific attributes for easy reference, triage, or manipulation. Once violations are registered, Caliper facilitates remediation by providing a single-click method of viewing the defects using the model browser. You can also easily launch your IDE for making repairs. When Caliper is deployed early in the development cycle, it can identify defects before they reach the test or integration phase of a project, therefore reducing costs.</p>
