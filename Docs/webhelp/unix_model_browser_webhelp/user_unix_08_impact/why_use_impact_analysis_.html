<p class="p1"><b>Why Use Impact Analysis?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Perhaps one of the most challenging aspects of your work as a software engineer involves anticipating, proposing, and making changes to your source code. Before you make changes, you probably ask yourself several important questions:</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>What are my options for changing an element of source?</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>Where and how often does the element I want to change occur in my source?</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>How do the changes I want or need to make affect other elements and files within my source?</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>What files do I need to recompile when I’m done?</p>
<p class="p2">The answers to these questions can be difficult to find. Without this information, you face the risk of lengthened build schedules, the introduction of new errors in your source, or even compromised code quality. DIScover’s Impact Analysis tool helps you find the answers, automatically and efficiently, <i>before</i> you make any changes to your source code.</p>
<p class="p2">Impact Analysis allows you to examine the options for and consequences of performing proposed changes to your source code. More specifically, Impact Analysis illustrates how change will affect, or impact, your source, enabling you to make decisions about whether or not you should make a change.</p>
<p class="p2">Impact Analysis illustrates the possible changes you can make to a selected entity. You can then use the impact diagram to propose changes and learn how they affect the rest of your source. Impact Analysis displays a comprehensive list of affected files and entities, and shows you which files require recompiling after the change.</p>
<p class="p2">For example, if you select a field entity, Impact Analysis presents a schematic diagram to show you how you can change the field’s name, type, or permission.</p>
<p class="p2">Using the diagram and dialog boxes that appear when you select a change option, you are free to experiment with modifications—without risk. Impact Analysis illustrates the results of change without actually changing your source code. The analysis allows you to make informed decisions, adhere to coding standards, and make a realistic estimate on how long it takes to apply the changes.</p>
