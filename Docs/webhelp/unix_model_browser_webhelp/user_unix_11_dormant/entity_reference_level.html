<p class="p1"><b>Entity Reference Level</b></p>
<p class="p2">Dormant performs its analysis downstream of the root entity; that is, it analyzes only those entities to which the root entity refers (or does not refer); its analysis does not include entities that refer to the root entity.</p>
<p class="p2">Consequently, you should select root entities that are relatively high in your application’s hierarchy of reference. The lower the root entity’s reference level, the greater the number of entities that Dormant identifies as dormant. If the reference level of the root entity is too low, the results of your analysis may include entities that are not actually dormant.</p>
<p class="p2">The function <span class="s1">main</span> is a typical choice for the root entity of a dormant code analysis. You might also select a root from among the entities in a library, although it is up to you to determine which entity has the highest reference level.</p>
