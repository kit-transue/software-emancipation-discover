<p class="p1"><b>Graphing</b></p>
<p class="p2">The Graph view displays the paths (call dependencies) between two functions. Graphs are useful for debugging or navigating through complex source code and header files. Using graphs, you can improve your comprehension of the possible traces between two functions.</p>
<p class="p2">A graph uses the information model to track all possible paths between two functions. Unlike Call Tree Diagrams, which show specific, immediate paths from a given entity, a graph lets you take a set of functions and determine what, if any, paths exist between them.</p>
<p class="p2">This is especially useful when you are trying to comprehend the relations between a specific set of functions. For example, if, between two functions in a debugging session your software behaves inappropriately, you can use a graph to plot all paths the software can take. You might know of only one path, but a graph shows all others.</p>
<p class="p2">A graph, in conjunction with transitive closure, provides a comprehensive course between two functions. Impact Analysis can tell you that a change affects an entity, and <b>Closure</b> shows you that a there is a relationship between two functions, but a graph shows every function in the call path between two functions.</p>
