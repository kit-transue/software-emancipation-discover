<p class="p1"><b>DIScover Overview</b></p>
<p class="p2">DIScover is a complete enterprise-wide, software development information system comprised of a series of tools created to address some of today's most challenging software development problems. DIScover examines source code and related artifacts, creating an accessible, scalable, common database of information (the <i>information model</i>). The information model captures the relationships among all entities resulting in a high-level architectural perspective and a detailed view of the entire application, which can be shared across the organization and monitored over time. DIScover enables software professionals to more thoroughly understand their software systems, to more efficiently and accurately effect changes to a large body of source code, and to more easily re-engineer or reorganize a complex software system, thus improving organizational productivity and quality while reducing cost and time to market.</p>
<p class="p2">DIScover is a solution written for developers, by developers who understand the unique challenges of authoring and understanding complex bodies of source code in a team environment. As a software developer, you know that it can be difficult to decipher existing bodies of source or make intelligent decisions on future actions with little supporting data, but these tasks are often necessary before you can effectively complete your piece of a development project.</p>
<p class="p2">DIScover combines the feature-rich Browser and Quality Analysis interfaces with special purpose Access and Developer Xpress clients to create a robust, fully customizable code comprehension and quality system to meet the needs of your development environment.</p>
