<p class="p1"><b>Project</b></p>
<p class="p2">A DIScover<i> project</i> defines the content of an individual information model, and is designed to mirror your organizationâ€™s software development projects. Selecting a project sets the scope of your browsing activities, as only files and entities included in that project are available for browsing and querying.</p>
<p class="p2">When building an information model, the DIScover administrator decides which files to include in the model; this decision is based on which individual software development projects need to be modeled and how that project is divided. For example, an organization that is completing development on a software application called X might actually have a main development project called X, and smaller branches of development individually identified by unique project names, XY and XZ.</p>
<p class="p2">There are several information model scenarios to fit this scheme: a single information model that includes all source files from project X; in this case, the information model would have a main project with all source files and subprojects that contained only those files from the individual branches of development. You could also have a smaller information model that contains only the source files from project XY or XZ; in this case, you would only have one project containing the files from that branch of development.</p>
<p class="p2">We recommend checking with your administrator to understand how models have been created in your environment, verify the names of projects that are available to you for browsing and querying, and possibly request that a new model be created for a project you are working on.</p>
