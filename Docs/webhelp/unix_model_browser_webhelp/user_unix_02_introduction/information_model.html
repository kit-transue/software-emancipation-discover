<p class="p1"><b>Information Model</b></p>
<p class="p2">The key to DIScover’s unique capabilities is a structure called the <i>information model </i>(often referred to as <i>model</i> in this guide). This data repository is created when DIScover examines your source, parses the code, and instead of creating object files, saves it in two language-independent formats: the <i>Source Mode Tree</i> (SMT) and the <i>Abstract Syntax Tree</i> (AST).</p>
<p class="p2">The parsing process recognizes individual code constructs from your source (such as each function, class, variable, and so on) as a single entity (described in the next book). A catalog of all your code’s symbols, line numbers, and offsets is maintained in the SMT, while the AST retains a richer structure of data that tracks information about these entities, including their attributes and the relations between them. Physically, an index of symbols and tables of relations among symbols is stored in <i>pmod</i> files.</p>
<p class="p2">In the enterprise environment, information models are routinely created and maintained by the DIScover administrator so individual users can simply connect to an available model.</p>
