<p class="p1"><b>Working With Groups</b></p>
<p class="p2">A <i>group</i> is a (permanent or temporary) collection of related files or entities. Groups can contain any entity, instance, or combination of entities and instances.</p>
<p class="p2">You can use groups to track your progress on files from a specific project, save the full or partial results from a lengthy or sophisticated query, or understand relationships throughout an application or between multiple applications.</p>
<p class="p2">You can create and maintain groups by accessing the Group Manager through the <b>Tools &gt; Group Manager</b> menu or the <b>Group</b> button in the Browser or Minibrowser. The Group Manager offers options that allow you to administer your groups, such as displaying or adding members, as well as perform set operations, such as viewing intersections and unions.</p>
<p class="p2">The Group Manager contains the following menus:</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Group</b> provides administrative operations, including <b>Create</b>, <b>Rename</b>, <b>Delete</b>, <b>Save</b>, <b>Print</b>, <b>Refresh</b>, and <b>Close</b>.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Elements</b> allows you to <b>Add</b>, <b>Remove</b>, or <b>Replace</b> members (selected entities) to and from a group.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Operator</b> provides group operations, such as calculating and viewing group intersections and unions.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span><b>Browse</b> enables you to display all instances of entities contained in the group using an instances view, the main Browser, or the Minibrowser.</p>
<p class="p2">Group administration, performed through the <b>Group</b> menu of the Group Manager, allows you to create, rename, save, and delete groups.</p>
