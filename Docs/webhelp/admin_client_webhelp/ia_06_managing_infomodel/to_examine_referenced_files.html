<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>3</b></span><span class="s2"><b>   </b></span>Find all files that were included by all these files and create a Group 2.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>4</b></span><span class="s2"><b>   </b></span>In the <b>Group</b> menu, select <b>Group X minus Y</b> to examine the difference between Group 2 and Group 1.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>6</b></span><span class="s2"><b>   </b></span>Ask a developer to browse Group 3 for any files that may need to be included.</p>
<p class="p3">To examine referenced functions, use the same procedure, looking for all functions instead of files.</p>
<p class="p3">You can also validate your model by reviewing the build log generated by the administration client. Based on the number of source files to be parsed, which is generated during the early "processing build log" phase of the model build, the build log displays the following:</p>
<p class="p2">•<span class="s2">   </span><b>Attempted</b> displays how many source files DIScover attempted to parse.</p>
<p class="p2">•<span class="s2">   </span><b>Cleanly parsed</b> displays the number of source files that were parsed without errors. Typically, a parse error represents a single operation that is not accurately reflected in the model. Sparse parse errors may prevent you from proving properties in the code, but they rarely detract from using the model for code comprehension.</p>
<p class="p2">•<span class="s2">   </span><b>In the model</b> displays the number of source files that were processed and incorporated into the model. If some files were not incorporated into the model, the model is incomplete. You can review the build log to evaluate how significant one or more missing files are.</p>
