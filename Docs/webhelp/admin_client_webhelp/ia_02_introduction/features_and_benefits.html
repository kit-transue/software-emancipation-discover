<p class="p1"><b>Features and Benefits</b></p>
<p class="p2">DIScover’s rich, sophisticated picture of your source code allows you to:</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>comprehend and manage your software development assets</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>standardize and automate your code quality analysis</p>
<p class="p2">The ability to quickly and completely comprehend existing code saves time, allowing you to focus on development. Software projects can be completed in a shorter time frame, at a lower cost, and with optimum flexibility.</p>
<p class="p2">Impact analysis gives your team a distinct advantage—the ability to understand how proposed changes will affect the rest of the code base before you make them, break something, and have to remediate. Impact analysis in fact reduces the introduction of new bugs or development issues by 50 percent.</p>
<p class="p2">Quality filters allow you to identify specific patterns in your code, and automate coding standards. This systematic, early intervention technique allows you to find problems in your source code—even in projects with millions of lines of code—<i>before</i> your customers do, and results in dramatic time and cost savings for your team.</p>
