<p class="p1"><b>Entities and Instances</b></p>
<p class="p2">The term <i>entity</i> is used to describe any individual element of your source code maintained in the AST. An entity may be as large as an entire file or as small as a variable. In the model browser, entities are categorized by name: file, function, class, variable, method, enum, string. Selecting one category displays all entities of that type that appear in your source code.</p>
<p class="p2">The term <i>instance</i> refers to a single occurrence of an entity in your source. A single entity may have multiple instances. For example, a single function may be referenced in multiple source files; in this case, the function has a single instance in each place in the source where it is called.</p>
