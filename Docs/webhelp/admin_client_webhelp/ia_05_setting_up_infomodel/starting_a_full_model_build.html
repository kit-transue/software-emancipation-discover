<p class="p1"><b>Starting a Full Model Build</b></p>
<p class="p2">Using the information you specify when you first create an information model, DIScover performs a <i>full model build</i>, creating a <i>model version</i> of your software. Building software can involve variations among compilers, or files that need to be mounted on the network, which can prevent some or all of the files from making it into the model. DIScover makes available a list of failed files along with descriptions of the causes in the form of a model build log.</p>
<p class="p2">Depending on the size of your software project, the model build process can take a long time; however, after you perform your first full model build, you incrementally update the model using the incremental model build feature (for more information, see <a href="../ia_06_managing_infomodel/updating_an_information_model_incrementally.html#XREF_Updating_an_Information"><span class="s1">Updating an Information Model Incrementally</span></a>).</p>
<p class="p2">Your software build cycle, available system resources, and your objectives in examining your information model should drive your decisions about how frequently you build a model.</p>
<p class="p2">Before you build a model, note the following:</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s2">   </span>Make sure you have enough disk space. If you build a model without sufficient disk space, various errors occur in the administration client.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s2">   </span>Information models consume a large amount of disk space, and several versions of the same model can exist in your environment at one time. While this is an effective way to evaluate code quality over time, we recommend planning for the maximum resource needs before you determine the frequency of your model building process.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s2">   </span>If you are performing a full model build from an existing running model version, you do not have to stop the model first. When you perform a full model build, the running model version is automatically stopped.</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s2">   </span>On Windows, all file names in the model are converted to lowercase. This does not affect your source files.</p>
