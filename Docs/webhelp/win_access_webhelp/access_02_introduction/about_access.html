<p class="p1"><b>About Access</b></p>
<p class="p2">Access is more than an important tool in the DIScover family. It underlies the functionality of database queries and set operations, plus the specializations of:</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>Tree Pattern Matching, used to examine and traverse the parse tree</p>
<p class="p3">•<span class="s1">   </span>Change Propagation, used to make automated changes to source</p>
<p class="p2">Access scripts can be used again and again; the possibilities are endless. For example, you can apply the same kind of analysis used in one project to another project. Or, you can apply an existing automated tool that you use every day to transform software to newly purchased source code bases. Scripts written by one developer can be distributed to others, leveraging that developer’s expertise in a problem domain.</p>
<p class="p2">If the needs of your organization are particularly specialized, Access provides the mechanism for tailoring DIScover to those needs. For example, an embedded environment’s debugger may have limitations on setting breakpoints that mean that the conditional operator should not be used, that an if statement should be used instead. You can write an Access script to detect this and add it to the Quality Assessment Report, if necessary. Or, if your organization has a sophisticated checklist for impact analysis or code reviews, you can support these in an automatic fashion using Access.</p>
<p class="p2">Because Access scripts can be applied to the code base at any time, they offer advantages over manual changes for long-duration projects. Consider a porting project that extends over a couple of months. One team of developers would have to check each file for non-portable constructs, fix issues found in that file, and then move on to the next. Over the course of the project, developers assigned to other projects have the opportunity to reintroduce non-portable constructs. With an Access script that detects the constructs found in the first pass, the porting team can periodically revalidate their work.</p>
<p class="p2">The fast turnaround time of Change Propagation scripts offers tremendous advantages, making it possible to change a large number of files in a short time. This often reduces the need for merges because a file spends less time checked out, and it can offer the potential of scheduling changes: you can develop and test the Change Propagation script without actually submitting the changes. Then, when your team is ready for those changes (say, early in the next release cycle), you can introduce them quickly and efficiently.</p>
