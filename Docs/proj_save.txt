			Project Server (Save/Restore)
			Fri Jun  7 16:20:48 EDT 1996

Objective: DISCOVER supports Project Save/Restore functionality
	   starting from aset version 5.0.0.52. The project provides
	   ability to save Project structure in ASCII format and to
	   restore the Project structure while expanding instead of
	   reading real File System information.

Conventions:

	PRJ file	  - ASCII file with Project structure
	PMOD file	  - Project DISCOVER MODEL file ( .sym file )
	ROOT project 	  - top level PDF project, that does not have PMOD file
	ROOT-PMOD project - top level PDF project that has PMOD file
	PMOD project	  - PDF subproject, that has PMOD file

Functional Specifications:

	Project structure for project "/a" is saved in the PRJ file "a.pmod.prj"
        at the same directory where the file "a.pmod.sym" would appear. 

	PMOD projects are saved in the separate PRJ file, that contains the
	complete Project structure.

	ROOT projects are saved in the separate PRJ file, that contains the Project
	structure from the top to PMOD projects (if any). If there are no PMOD 
	projects under the ROOT project, than the PRJ file contains the complete
	project structure.

	DISCOVER renames an existing PRJ file into <filename>.bak

Project Save Commands:

	discover -batch -pdf <PDF> -save_proj [project_name]

	Without the parameter saves all ROOT and PMOD projects from the PDF.
	The parameter must be either ROOT project or PMOD project.

	discover -batch -pdf <PDF> -save_root [project_name]

	Saves PMOD Projects that do not have PRJ files or the PRJ files are outdated.
	The PRJ file is considered outdated, if the date stamp on the .sym file
	is later than on .prj file. For the PMOD projects there is an additional
	checking added in interactive DISCOVER session: whether the real .sym file
	size is different from the size, stored in the PRJ file.
	Always saves ROOT projects.

User Environment Variables:

	DIS_NOPRJ  	- turns off the Project restore from prj files

Debug Environment Variables:

	DIS_PRJ_FILE	- saves PRJ file into value of the variable.
	DIS_PRJ_DEBUG	- turns on additional output on standard output.
