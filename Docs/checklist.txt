			DISCOVER Release Checklist
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I. Summary

This document provides a brief checklist of basic usage and feature
availability that must be satisfied before DISCOVER may be released 
to a customer. It is intended that this be used as a guide for the 
final hands-on verification of any new release or patch. 

This checklist is simply a "sanity-check" and should not be used to 
verify the existence of any real DISCOVER functionality. This is
intended as a brief overview of the product. The goal is to touch 
upon each major area of operation as briefly as possible, and answer
questions like: Is there anything glaringly wrong with the product?
Are all the major features available for use? It is assumed that the
product has already been tested internally, so this checklist may 
be used to ensure that the release areas are fully intact, and that 
no catastrophic defects were somehow missed before the product is 
finally entombed on some media and sent to the customer.

II. Preparation

First log out of the machine completely (this might entail logging out
of your window manager, and then logging out of the console shell.) Log 
back in and start up X. 

Global shell variables (most notably "PATH" and "PSET_*") can cause 
unpredictable or non-standard behavior, so it is best to use a "clean" 
environment when testing. The easiest way to clean out your environment 
is to execute the following commands (in t?csh):

	% unsetenv *
	% /usr/local/bin/tcsh

This will ensure that you are using the default t?csh environment.

Since we will be using the "Learn" environment, it is important that you 
clean out any old Learn files that you might have. The following command 
usually does the trick:

	% rm -rf ~/DISCOVER/Learn

III. The Checklist

Report any issues that you encounter as you go through this checklist.

A. Start-up

   a. Invoke the learn environment by typing "discover -learn".       

      1. Make sure there are no tar extraction errors. 

      2. Does the splash screen come up with the proper date, version 
         number, install location, and copyright info?

B. Browser

   a. Select /xip_private from the Home Project Selection dialog.
      
      1. Does the Browser come up?
      
      2. Can you activate scan mode?

C. Viewer

   a. Open up /xip_shared/src. Double-click on xip.c. 
      
      1. Does Emacs pop-up with xip.c displayed in the buffer?

      2. Can you double-click on projects and navigate through folders 
         in the minibrowser?

   b. Switch back to the text view of xip.c with the Viewer history 
      button.

      1. Can you find a token's location and type info by shift-LMB-
         clicking on it?

      2. Can you do this for "reglist" on line 37?

D. CM

   a. With the text view of xip.c still in the Viewer, select Manage -> 
      Get. Does the CM/sw Monitor Window come up and check-out the file 
      without any errors? ("Get completed for /xip/src/xip.c" should 
      appear in the minibuffer.)

   b. Modify the file, save it with C-x C-s, and select Manage -> Put... 
      Enter a comment and select Put All. Was the file successfully 
      checked-in?

E. Update

   a. Double-click on stage.c (in /xip_shared/src) from the Browser. Hit 
      the Update button. Does the file parse successfully?

F. Report

   a. Select Utility -> REPORT/sw in the Browser. Edit the "Output to" 
      field to read "/usr/tmp/rep". Select Files from the categories 
      column and highlight TicTacToeGame.H in the elements column. 
      Select the Generate Report button. Does DISCOVER create a report 
      in /usr/tmp/rep?

G. Groups
   
   a. In scan mode, select Files from the Categories column. Select the 
      source code module init.c from the Elements column and highlight 
      Defines from the Ask column. Highlight all of the variables (icon 
      resembles an X) in the Results column and select the Group button. 
      Does the Group Manager pop-up with a new group (GROUP-1) listed?

H. Debug

   a. Select View -> New Viewer from the Browser. In the Viewer, click on 
      Debug -> Set Debugger -> GDB 4.14. Now select Debug -> Start Debugger.
      Does gdb come up successfully in a second pane at the bottom of the 
      Viewer?
  
I. Frame

   a. In the Browser, navigate to the root project. Scan for Files and 
      double-click on /xip/doc/requirements.doc. Hit OK when asked for 
      confirmation. 
  
      1. Does Frame pop-up with a document entitled "X Image Processor 
         Requirements" in the editor window?

      2. Is StageObj (on the second-to-last line) double-underlined?

J. Partition

   a. Close all Viewers and Frame sessions. Enter the /xip_shared/src 
      subproject and double-click on pipeline.c. When the Viewer comes 
      up, select Partition -> Simplify #includes. Does partition comment 
      out the include directives for stage.h and image_win.h?

   b. Double-click on fonts.c in the Browser. Shift-LMB-click on the 
      function name DaInitAppFonts (line 10). Select Partition -> 
      Move Entities. Append new.c to the file path in the Move Entities 
      to File dialog. Hit OK to this and any subsequent confirmation 
      dialogs. 
 
      1. Does the new file appear in the Viewer?

      2. Do you see the definition for the function you moved 
         (DaInitAppFonts) in the new file?

K. Package

   a. Quit DISCOVER and type "discover package -gui" at the shell 
      prompt. Does the Package window come up?

L. Misc

   a. Does the command "discover -v" display the correct version and date 
      info? (Check if it is consistent with the splash screen.)
