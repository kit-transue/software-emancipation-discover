<p class="p3"><b>Test Plan for External Languages Support</b></p>
<p class="p4">by</p>
<p class="p4">Scott Turner</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">External Language Support reimplements DISCOVER's information model construction. Here a strategy is presented to validate the new implementation.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Requirements</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The goals of this project are first, to identify defects arising from the transition to ELS, and second to update the existing set of routine tests to work with the new version of DISCOVER that supports external languages. It is essential for defects to be sought thoroughly, since regressions in this core aspect of DISCOVER could undermine the product's usability in practically any way conceivable.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">We need to catch problems in both modelbuild and interactive DISCOVER. But in addition to testing the complete system, it can be very useful to have tests that focus on the IF itself. Since we anticipate that most of the problems will be closely related to the IF, such problems can be understood and addressed more effectively if detected in the context of IF.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The kinds of failures to be detected include:</p>
<p class="p7">generation of incorrect IF syntax</p>
<p class="p7">generation of inconsistent IF content</p>
<p class="p7">generation of IF that does not correspond to the source code</p>
<p class="p7">generation of incomplete IF</p>
<p class="p7">catastrophic failure of the IF reader to process IF (correct or not)</p>
<p class="p7">failure of the IF parser to correctly handle correct IF</p>
<p class="p7">building an incorrect model</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The essential tool for validating the new implementation is DISCOVER's existing test base. Unfortunately, much of the test base is dependent on data structures that will change in the new implementation. This impediment must be overcome.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Implementation</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><b>Overview</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The work to be done has<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>four main aspects:</p>
<p class="p7">independent consistency testing of generated IF</p>
<p class="p7">validation of ELS support using batch/model tests</p>
<p class="p7">validation of ELS support using interactive/regression tests</p>
<p class="p7">establishment of routine use of tests revised for ELS</p>
<p class="p1">There are about 3000 interactive regression tests, 100 batch/model tests, and thousands of validation suite tests.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>Independent Validation of Parser-generated IF</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This will involve modifying the code for ELS support.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Checks will cover consistency of IF:</p>
<p class="p7">For each symbol, the kind is valid.</p>
<p class="p7">For each relation, the name is valid, and the source &amp; target symbols have kinds consistent with the relation.</p>
<p class="p7">For each attribute, the name is valid, the value is consistent with the attribute name, and both are consistent with the kind of symbol which has the attribute.</p>
<p class="p7">If source files are accessible, then 'location' objects can be validated as referring to an actual position in the file.</p>
<p class="p1">Checks will cover completeness of IF:</p>
<p class="p7">For each variable, function, or constant symbol, check that it has a type relation.</p>
<p class="p1">This list of consistency and completeness checks is not yet complete. It should try to check everything that DISCOVER assumes.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">? What source code will be run through this checking?</p>
<p class="p1">? How will errors be reported?</p>
<p class="p1">? Perhaps it could just send them to standard output or standard error, and the checks would be enabled during the running of regression and batch tests.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><b>Program Diagram</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The diagram below shows how DISCOVER builds and manipulates the model. Rectangles depict pieces of the DISCOVER program. Ellipses indicate storage formats and APIs that store or communicate the model. Solid and dashed lines are used for existing code and new ELS code, respectively. The representations and transformations shown are not tied to any particular run of DISCOVER.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Where the DISCOVER model is now dumped in human-readable form, a new capability will be added to dump using IF. This change is shown in the diagram using dotted lines.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Comparisons</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The problematic aspect of testing the new implementation is to ensure that the new data structures are equivalent to the old. It is necessary to compare IF.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">To compare the new data structures to the old:</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11">1.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Dump the astNode tree (dfa module) using IF syntax.</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11">2.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Compare 2 files of IF. This will parse the IF and produce a set of differences. It may dump the differences descriptively, something like the output of diff. Or it may dump the differences as the <i>input</i> to diff, so that its output may be substituted for the IF input, and the replaced files compared using diff as before.</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p11">3.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The comparison function is non-trivial, since the IF is a graph. Symbols will be matched by name and kind within the global and class contexts. Relations will be matched based on their name, source and target. Then differences will be reported.</p>
<p class="p12">symbol absent from one file</p>
<p class="p12">symbol attributes or locations differ between files</p>
<p class="p12">relation absent from one file</p>
<p class="p12">relation attributes differ between files</p>
<p class="p12">AST tree or node difference</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">An alternative approach would make smaller modifications to the existing dumping, massaging it after it has been dumped, and then comparing it using diff. In my opinion there would be too many differences in form for external massaging to make this approach practical.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>Batch/Model Tests</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The routine tests consist of</p>
<p class="p7">interactive regression tests (recorded)</p>
<p class="p7">batch tests</p>
<p class="p7">validation suites, e.g. Perennial</p>
<p class="p1">Normally the batch tests and validation suites do not dump the "AST" data structures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In these tests, ultimately what matters is that the new model matches the old. However, the value of comparing the IF is that these tests give a simpler test framework in which to validate that the new IF matches what the old product produced. Also, in case the models do not match, the IF comparison will provide a basis for tracking down the problem.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>Test Details</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The diagrams below show the model representation changes which occur in each kind of test.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Batch:</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The current batch test starts with source code and a saved dump. It constructs the model, saves it, restores it, and dumps. The new dump is compared to the saved.</p>
<p class="p1">Interactive:</p>
<p class="p1">The current interactive tests start with source code and a saved dump. It constructs the model and dumps. The new dump is compared to the saved.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Test of EDG parser:</p>
<p class="p1">A basic test of the EDG parser can be accomplished before we complete the ability to build the model from IF. This test starts with source code. It constructs an IF file using the EDG parser. It also runs the GCC parser, building a model, and dumping an IF file based on that model. The two IF files are compared.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Loopback:</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A loopback test starts with just source code. It constructs the model using ELS techniques including IF. Then the model is dumped as IF. The two IF files are compared.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Other:</p>
<p class="p1">Note that the existing batch tests can still be run against an ELS-based DISCOVER. This could be a valuable testing mode, since it would not assume the ability to dump IF. The benefits of usnig IF are (1) it is easier to construct an intelligent comparison utility and (2) it can validate the EDG parser directly, for easier tracking down of problems.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Existing interactive tests would require more adaptation to be used in their current mode, because an ELS-based discover would not have any AST globals to dump. Still, running these tests would be valuable, because the importance of checking the AST globals is secondary. The testing would be modified to circumvent the comparison of AST globals.</p>
<p class="p13"></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>Strategy</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Once the comparison mechanism is implemented, using it to validate the ELS support might be rough sailing. Differences in ordering and in symbol numbering may make no substantive difference to the model, yet prevent the IF from being effectively compared using ‘diff’. To handle this difficulty, this plan anticipates making improvements comparing IF. Not only that, it allows the comparison to be tweaked from one test run to another by use of shell variables or something of the kind.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It may be particularly useful to have different levels of enforcement of matching one IF file to another. Then the checker can relax one aspect of enforcement and still validate other aspects as much as possible.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Where differences show up between the old AST and the new ELS AST, different resolutions are possible.</p>
<p class="p1">The new AST may be judged inappropriate for the IF, in which case the EDG-based parser would need to be modified.</p>
<p class="p1">The new AST may be considered an acceptable change, adding to the complexity of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>IF-based validation of the ELS implementation.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The impact of superficial differences will not be limited to the comparison of the IF file to its corresponding astNode-based AST. Some differences can be expected in the SMT and DD as well. In cases of problematic noise, might they be dealt with using</p>
<p class="p1">modifications to SMT/DD dumping (as IF), or</p>
<p class="p1">modifications to diff in the form of a filter which precedes the application of diff</p>
<p class="p1">intelligent comparison of IF files based on the IF parser</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Since there is likely to be a good deal of human analysis involved, the amount of effort to be put into this will be a judgment call.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p14">Risks</p>
<p class="p15"><br></p>
<p class="p1">First, despite the large number of existing tests, not every possible defect is covered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But even within the scope of the existing tests, this plan is not perfect. The comparison of IF will not be perfect, nor will the generation of IF from AST nodes in the GCC-based product. These limitations of the plan are considered small; little is expected to “slip through the cracks”.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>New Generation of Tests</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The following ideas for future testing are preliminary, as there has been little discussion so far.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Some of the needed work deals with putting the existing tests in place for the ELS version of DISCOVER, beyond the transitional effort of ensuring that DISCOVER is functioning correctly and that we have the basis for a new generation of tests. In the future, the testing setup will need to be different from all of the methods diagrammed above. It will be analogous to the existing tests. Note that the analog of dumping AST globals will be to preserve the IF file used to build the model.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Will there be an awkward stage at which many of the tests are ready for automatic execution, while a substantial number are not yet validated due to large, impenetrable sets of diffs? In a way yes, but it need not be awkward. All that's needed is a list of tests that have not been validated, so that these can be run in transitional, validation mode. At this stage, the full set of tests will be run automatically against saved results that have been updated, recognizing that not every saved result is known to be correct.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Effort</b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The efforts required by this plan may be divided as follows:</p>
<p class="p7">Get up to speed on building DISCOVER. (2 days)</p>
<p class="p7">Modify DISCOVER to dump information in IF form.</p>
<p class="p16">Dump DD as IF. (2 days)</p>
<p class="p16">Dump SMT as IF. (2 days)</p>
<p class="p16">Dump astNodes as IF. (2 days)</p>
<p class="p7">Get agreement on how to insert the new code and enable it. (1 day)</p>
<p class="p7">Make comparison of IF sufficiently smart, possibly adapting IF parser and modifying test scripts. (5 days)</p>
<p class="p7">Get the tests running in EDG test mode (getting up to speed). (3 days)</p>
<p class="p7">Get tests running in loopback mode. (1 day)</p>
<p class="p7">Try the tests without IF dumping.</p>
<p class="p16">Batch (1 day)</p>
<p class="p16">Interactive (1 day)</p>
<p class="p7">Help analyze test results.</p>
<p class="p16">EDG mode (2 days)</p>
<p class="p16">Loopback mode (2 days)</p>
<p class="p16">Batch</p>
<p class="p16">Interactive</p>
<p class="p7">A cycle of running tests, identifying and fixing problems in the comparison methods, and identifying and fixing problems in the generated IF. (some days included elsewhere, could need to expand)</p>
<p class="p7">Revise intelligent comparison of IF, as needed. (2 days)</p>
<p class="p7">Pass on information regarding how to run the new tests. (1 day)</p>
<p class="p7">Add to the IF parser code that validates the IF, and construct the consistency tests. (9 days)</p>
<p class="p7">Update existing tests so that they can be routinely run with the ELS version of DISCOVER. (2 days)</p>
