        Project: Skip (do not send to parser) include files which already have been included and parsed in previous compiled units and which are the same after preprocessing.

        The idea is to compare check sums for every header file after preprocessing . So, if we have files "a.c" , "b.c" and both of them include file "a.h", we keep result of preprocessing for "a.h" after importing the first file ("a.c"). Then, while importing "b.c", compare result of new preprocessing of "a.h" with previous, and if they are the same, skip "a.h" this time (not reparse it).

        Some problems and solutions.

        Typical cases are: same file is included once to each compilation unit with same text. For this case we just insert text of this file only once and insert name of this file to the list of skipped files (this list is supplied additionally to cpp output). More complicated, but real case: file (for example, "tree.def") is including to the some of the compilation units more than once. For this case we will specify this file as exotic file and will see this file as part of its including file.
