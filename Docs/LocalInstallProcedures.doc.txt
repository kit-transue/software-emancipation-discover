Local Install Procedures
Mar 1, 1994 - revised 3/16/94

=====================================

Ideally, to create a fresh install.new:

1) Tell Bruce Fredericks that we are about to blow away install.new

2) Decide whether install.new is good enough to replace install.  Ask Bella how
the regression tests have gone.  If you're not going to replace install, skip
to step 3.
    Rotate the older install to make room for the new

	> rlogin pragma -l builder
	> cd $SYSBASE
	> rm -rf install.old
	> mv install install.old
	> mv install.new install
   Send mail telling everyone that install has changed

3) Create install.new

	> rlogin pragma -l builder
	> local_install.sh


=====================================
The following discussion elaborates on step 2, if you're not sure there's 
enough room for all three directory trees.

2) Decide whether install.new is good enough to replace install.  Ask Bella how
the regression tests have gone.  If you're not going to replace install, skip
to step 3.

Now decide whether there's enough room on /ParaSET for all three:

Each local install takes up over 165 meg. This breaks down as
follows:

	parasniff	9   meg
	sun4-O		52  meg
	sun4-g		104 meg

Start by checking current free space, using
    df  /ParaSET

Then check whether deleting the present install.old will free up enough space.
    du -s $sb/install.old

When there is not enough disk space for all three installs, I end up deleting
stuff that is not needed as much from the older installs. For example, you usually only
need one parasniff directory, so you can get 9 megs by deleting it from install
and/or install.old.  You can even delete the sun4-g side of install.old and just
leave sun4-O This will cause users of sun4-g who have not restarted since the rename
of install to install.old to crash, but most people use sun4-O. You can always send a
mail message giving them 15 minutes warning too.

Lots of times install.new never makes it to install.  Often, instead of rotating
the local install, I just delete install.new and create another one. I don't usually
send mail in this case. In any case, install.new should not be moved to install
until Bella has had a chance to run regression tests on it. Ask Bella if she thinks
the current install.new is bug-free enough to be moved to install.
