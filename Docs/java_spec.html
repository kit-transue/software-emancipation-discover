<h3>Supported Features</h3>
<p>
DISCOVER will support the Java language. Below are listed the ways in which
this will make a difference in how DISCOVER is used. The 08-03 revision adds
support for throw and catch relations. The 09-02 revision is an update reflecting
how the implementation eventually worked out the details. Note that 
some user interface elements are yet unimplemented.
</p>
<h4>categories of scan mode &amp; model browser (kinds)</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Interfaces</strong>, new category<br>
A new kind/category is
provided for Java interfaces, due to the distinction which Java developers make,
and because some of the relationships have a different flavor depending on whether
you've got a class or an interface. </p>
<blockquote><small><p>Are interfaces no more than a restricted form of class?
Not in Java, even though every class is an interface in the sense that it
declares public members and can be used to declare objects.
A Java interface can be inherited freely, whereas a Java class
can be inherited only by classes, and classes can only inherit from one
superclass.
These restrictions prevent some of the ambiguities that occur with
multiple inheritance in C++.
</p></small></blockquote>
<p>Interfaces show up similarly to classes in inheritance hierarchy
diagrams.
</p>
<li><p><strong>Packages</strong>, like C++ namespaces, make sense in a Java model
as a category/kind. 
Currently DISCOVER does not support namespaces, but does support PL/SQL packages,
which are somewhat similar to Java packages.
Java packages will be internally implemented with the same ddKind,
<code>DD_PACKAGE</code>.</p>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>queries (ask column of scan mode &amp; model browser)</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Classes get a new query, "Show Super-Interfaces".
       Queries for interfaces are the same as those for classes, except that
       interfaces have no "Show Super-Classes" query, but they <em>do</em> have
       a "Show Sub-Interfaces" query. These differences are based on the inherent
       distinction between interfaces and classes.</p>
<li><p>Queries relating to packages will include
       <ul><li>For a package, the "Show Nested Classes" and "Show Nested Interfaces"
               queries list the types declared in it.
           <li>For a class, the "Show Containing" query lists the
               package or class containing it.
           <li>For a package, the "Show Containing" query
               lists the package containing it (if any).
           <li>The "Where Used", "Uses" etc. queries are also present and
               useful for packages.
       </ul></p>
<li><p>Exception-handling queries will be added, since exceptions are particularly
       important for Java, and are overdue for support in C++. These will include
       <ul><li>for an exception class, listing the functions that throw it
           <li>for a function, listing the exception classes that it throws
           <li>for an exception class, listing the functions that catch it
           <li>for a function, listing the exception classes that it catches
       </ul>
	These relations will be implemented so as to be usable equally for
        Java and C++ source code.</p>
<li><p>Other queries unique to the Java language or environment may be needed.
At this time, only the following possibility has been identified.
<ul><li>Synchronization objects play a unique role, and the subset of used/user
        relations that originate from <code>synchronized</code> statements
        could be a useful addition to the "ask" list.
</ul>
</p>
</ul>
<small><p></p></small>
<h4>names in packages</h4>
<p>
Names in packages, particularly class names, will be displayed fully-qualified. For
example, the name of the <code>indexOf</code> method of the standard <code>String</code>
class will appear in DISCOVER as
<pre>
      java.lang.String.indexOf(char ch)
</pre>
</p>
<h4>graphical views</h4>
<p>
Several unique Java features should show up disctinctively in graphical views.
<ul>
<li>
The "package" level of accessibility is the default for Java class members,
and is distinct from public, protected, and private.
This will be shown in the display of class members using an orange color.
<li>
As mentioned above, Java interfaces fill a role much like classes, 
and will appear in the same relationships as classes in graphical views.
The interface vs. class distinction will be evident in expert mode,
due to displaying interfaces with a distinctive shape <em>(TBD)</em>.
<li>
Non-final methods will show up in expert mode with
the same distinguishing black tab in the lower left corner as virtual methods.
<small><em>This use of the tab is awkward, because for consistency
of meaning with C++ virtual functions, it shows the tab when the 
attribute is absent. 
</em></small>
<li>
Abstract methods will show up in expert mode with
the same distinguishing two black tabs in the left corners as pure virtual methods.
<li>
Final versus non-final fields will also be distinguished in
expert mode by a black tab in the lower right corner,
due to the analogous usage of "const" in C++.
<small><em>
Note that the meaning of "final" for fields is rather different from
its meaning for methods.
</em></small>
<li>Synchronized methods will be distinguished in expert mode
by a black tab in the upper right corner (the same as the indicator of "volatile" in C++).
<small><em>
I'm open to other ideas that would not be blatantly overloading the meaning
of this tab.
</em></small>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Access/sw</h4>
<p>
Access commands and attributes will be added for the following:
<ul>
<li>"package_prot" access of entities (as distinct from public, private, etc.)
<li>"interface" and "package" attributes, analogous to existing "class" and "structure" attributes
<li>"final" attribute of members and classes
<li>"transient" attribute of fields
<li>"synchronized" attribute of methods
<li>"abstract" attribute of classes and methods
<li>"native" attribute of methods
<li>"throws_actual" and "throws_declared", and "catch" relations
</ul>
In addition, the destructor attribute will reflect whether a given method is
a Java "finalize" method.
</p>
<h4>text</h4>
<p>
Different programming languages are defined using different terms,
and Java is no exception.
In Java, every function is preferably called a "method", even if it
does not depend implicitly on an instance of its class.
The browser's category list now shows functions and methods as 
"Functions/Methods" rather than "Functions".
</p>
<p>
Some text varies, depending on whether the context is Java or C/C++.
Functions, when selected in the browser, are displayed in the status bar
as "method".
Classes are displayed as "struct" in C++, but Java classes will show up as "class". 
</p>
<p>
The queries that are presented in the "Ask" column for any given kind of
object depend on the set of languages included in the current project.
They do not vary depending on the object(s) selected.
</p>
<h4>initialization blocks</h4>
<p>Initialization blocks in classes consist of code that belongs to the class
and not to any particular method or constructor.
Initialization blocks are supported in outline views, and for the relations
involving instances within the block.
</p>
<h4>prefs</h4>
<p>
<table border>
<tr><th>preference<th>description
<tr><td><code>psetPrefs.ELS.List</code><td> will add support for Java
<tr><td><code>psetPrefs.ELS.Java.flags</code><td>new preference
<tr><td><code>psetPrefs.ELS.Java.suffix</code><td>new preference, e.g. .java
</table>
</p>
<h4>make flags extraction</h4>
<p>
It is expected that <code>make</code> is common enough with Java that our current
extraction strategy remains good as a default.
The <code>-D</code> options, however, will not be relevant to Java,
at least in our implementation.
The <code>-I</code> command line options are supplanted by
<code>-classpath</code>, at least for <code>javac</code>.
This <code>-classpath</code> will be supported in make flags extraction.
</p>
<p>As of 1998-10-02, the command line option is being implemented as <code>--classpath</code>
with two hyphens because the EDG command line parser doesn't support single-hyphen
options of the kind that javac uses.
The following make rule works:
<pre>
  . : /**/(*).java/%/.make => "echo --classpath /job1/new/regression/java/classes_1.1.zip"
</pre>
Since other expected make rules do not work,
extraction from make files does not work, either.
</p>
<h4>bulk compilation</h4>
<p>
EDG's jfe is capable of parsing a number of compilation units in one go.
This provides an efficiency analogous to precompiled headers,
without the risk of complications that occur with C and C++ preprocessing.
We will take advantage of this.
</p>
<h4>Unicode names and strings</h4>
<p>
Java permits Unicode characters in identifiers, strings, and character literals.
Java source can use a straight Unicode file format,
but normally the source file is encoded using plain ASCII or an 8-bit extension of
7-bit ASCII.
In this form, Unicode characters are indicated in the source
by means the <code>\u</code> escape sequence. 
DISCOVER will display Unicode characters in the same way.
</p>
<p>
Directly-encoded Unicode source files are not supported.
</p>
<h3>Outplan</h3>
<p>
Following are features which may have deserved consideration, but which
will not be supported by DISCOVER.
</p>
<h4>.cab "cabinet" form</h4>
<p>
Cabinets are a Microsoft-promoted, compressed, authenticated form for 
distribution of Java code on the Internet.
This will not be supported.
<br><small><em>Question: How proprietary is it?</em></small></p>
<h4>the Java package hierarchy</h4>
<p>Java provides a way to organize code hierarchically by package.
It would be nice to support this.  (What I have in mind is that
currently, the user of DISCOVER must go to some trouble to define
a project hierarchy. If the user has already developed a package
hierarchy for Java code, then he or she would prefer to avoid
the duplication of effort.) However, investigation revealed that
the package structure is not essential to Java, nor does it fit with
DISCOVER's way of presenting programs.  A package plays much the same
role as a C++ namespace.
</p>
<h4>documentation comments</h4>
<p>Documentation comments use a special standard syntax
which is recognized for extraction into external documentation. 
Not supported.</p>
<h4>component interfaces</h4>
<p>Up to now, DISCOVER has exposed the structure of programs from the point of
view of their source code.
Component-based programming deals with
properties, and events/messages of objects, that have a standardized capability
for querying an interface and dynamically linking to the compiled code which supports
the interface. A different potential project exists, with the goal of supporting COM.
</p>
<p>
Java Beans are the Java version of component-based programming. "Beans" are packaged
in <code>.jar</code> files, which have the same low-level structure as a <code>.zip</code>
file.  Hence, DISCOVER can support interfaces of Beans in the straight Java language sense.
In Java, the correspondence between the language interface of a class and its component
interface is simple, in comparison to COM. However, DISCOVER will not support the component level
interfaces as part of the Java project.</p>
<h4>C preprocessor</h4>
<p>Greg Bronner has reported that some people are using the C preprocessor with
Java code. It is yet to be determined how widespread this practice is.
The EDG parser does not incorporate a preprocessor, nor is this planned.</p>
<p>If we need to handle Java with preprocessing, a good approach would
be to adapt aset_CCcc.
aset_CCcc is already able to do preprocessing without compilation.
This has not been debugged to work with IF generation, but
it did work for the first simple case that was attempted.
Mike Miller estimates that the kinks could be worked out in a couple of days.
</p>
<p>However, this is not considered part of the plan for lack of confirmation of need among
potential customers.</p>
<h4>context sensitivity</h4>
<p>
Whether Java or C++ terminology is displayed will be controlled by a preference.
If a project contains both Java and C++ files, and an object is selected from
a Java file, then the query list will be formed using Java terminology.
</p>
<h4>names in packages</h4>
<p>
This complete presentation of a name is rather unwieldy, which could be a problem
for customers because it is good practice in Java to put your code into packages.
However, the implementation of scan mode is flexible and it will be fairly easy to
abbreviate the displayed names if we come up with a superior way of determining
what portion of the name to display.
