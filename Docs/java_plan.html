<h3>Goals and Requirements</h3>
<p>DISCOVER will support programming in the Java language.
Most importantly, DISCOVER must accept Java code, parsing it, analyzing it, and 
incorporating its significant relationships into a model.
</p>
<ul>
<li>speed: The speed of the Java front end must be as good as that of a fast compiler.
<li>input: It will digest straight Java source, as well as interfaces from .class files.
<li>user interface: A new category will be introduced in DISCOVER's scan mode, for Java "interface" types. New queries will be provided <em>as appropriate</em>.
Details of the features supported by this project are described in a separate functional
specification.
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
Implementation of Java support for DISCOVER will be uncomplicated, 
thanks to the work that has gone before in support for IF,
particularly for the C++ language which is (syntactically) nearly a superset of Java.
</p>
<h4>bulk compilation</h4>
<p>
A number of Java parsers, including EDG,
are capable of parsing a number of compilation units in one go.
This provides an efficiency analogous to precompiled headers,
without the risk of complications that occur with C and C++ preprocessing.
We will take advantage of this, and do not expect it to affect the user
interface.
This feature will require substantive effort of a day or two.
</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>
There are at present no good ways of verifying that a model built from Java is complete,
correct, or consistent, apart from manual inspection of the results.
If a more automatic mechanism were invented, it could affect the duration
of task 7 in either direction:
it could reduce the time spent testing, or it could lengthen the time spent fixing
(a larger number of) bugs and issues.
The testing plan is that a large quantity of Java code will be run
through the model build to detect crashes, compilation errors,
and such,
and that a large amount of spot inspection will be applied to verify apparently-successful
results.
</p>
<p>
Existing techniques of building regression tests are sufficient for this project.
</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>
We depend on EDG Java support of .class and .zip files. This means that the parser can
read declarations from the bytecode in these files.
EDG anticipates this feature being available in July.
Without this feature, DISCOVER's Java support would be generally useless.
</p>
<p>Implementation of model build for Java needs to wait until after 
we have IF generation fully implemented (based on Jfe or another Java parser).
</p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>MG, I believe, is of the opinion that the one week in the schedule above for tasks 2 and 3
is insufficient, but I do not know how much time he would allow for them. <em>Check with MG.</em>
</p>
<p>Unanticipated discoveries in the first three tasks, in particular, could negatively
impact the schedule;
a review of the schedule should be planned shortly after the evaluation,
functional specification, and design tasks are completed.
</p>
<p>
We assume that the EDG front end is selected. 
If the EDG front end were elminated, the schedule would be delayed
in order to find a suitable replacement, and implementation effort
would likely be greater. 
There are several reasons for this impact. First, EDG have attempted
to incorporate <em>a priori</em> our needs for source locations and the like
(having gained insight into these needs through the required enhancements to the C/C++
parser over the last eight months), 
while a parser that was designed strictly for compilation will likely require significant modifications to collect and maintain the information we need.
Second, although the EDG Java intermediate language is different in many ways
from that of their C/C++ product, a good deal of othe experience we have gained will carry over,
while working with the other compilers would have a longer learning curve.
</p>
<p>
The EDG Java front end is not yet proven as part of a usable product.
Though Java is a straightforward language and EDG has done a good deal
of testing, if we should choose EDG then we can expect a few substantial bugs to show up during the
development of Java support.
</p>
<p>
Since we are not plugged in to the Java community, it is hard to anticipate
all of the expectations/requirements of customers.
</p>
<h3>Tasks</h3>
Below are details of the scheduled tasks that need explanation. 
Numbers refer to the numbering of the schedule below.
<ol>
<li value="4"><p><strong>Write and unit test IF generation.</strong>
<br>To generate IF, a conventional compiler front end is augmented to create sections
as follows:
<ol>
<li>The map is created, consisting of MAP lines and the SYM lines for files.
<li>The symbols are defined and described, using SYM, REL, and ATR lines.
<li>SMT and ERR lines are dumped based on information saved during parsing.
SMT lines will be produced for literals.
<li>The AST is dumped by traversing the IL. Constant expressions will be
unfolded.
</ol>
<p>
Attention will be given to performance improvement
after the implementation is functioning.
</p>
</p>
<li value="5"><p><strong>Implement DISCOVER changes.</strong>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Model build support for Java will deal with AST operators and relations 
that are new with Java. These will be specified in a separate document.
In addition, Java usage of operators and relations may vary from their
usage in C/C++. Usage differences can be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, either by enhancing 
the model build or by modifying IF generation.

<li>User-visible features (documented more completely in the
functional specification) will require effort to implement
<ul>
<li>a new category
and additional queries
<li>new preferences
<li>make flags extraction for Java
</ul>
<li>Support for bulk compilation (described above) will be added.
</ul>
</p>
</ol>

<p>
Task 1 can be conducted in parallel with tasks 2 and 3. Tasks 4 and 5 can be conducted in paralled,
as can (and should) tasks 6 and 7.
The critical path is tasks 1, 4, and 7, for an elapsed time of 10.5 weeks.
