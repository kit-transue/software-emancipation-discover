Cutting a customer (or interim field release) tape:

All releases that ever go out to field are in
    /integ/paraset.1/*
one directory each.  Each such directory has exactly one subdirectory,
always called  paraset.   So version 1.0.2 is in
   /integ/paraset.1/paraset.1.0.2/paraset/*

In addition, there is a log file (text) maintained, called
    /integ/paraset.1/history
Be sure and add to it, whoever cuts a new release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install a new release:

1. edit splash screen text:
    ui/setup/splashScreen.h.C

   The first #define contains the text of the version, to be displayed in the
   upper right of the splash screen.
        #define PARASET_VERSION "1.0.3pre\n"

2. rebuild system

3. install to appropriate release directory

   rlogin  pragma -l builder      (this defines the SYSBASE env variable)
   su
   df        (make sure /integ has at least 50 mb or so)
   cd  /integ/paraset.1
   mkdir  paraset.1.xx.xx.x      or whatever
   cd     (ditto)
   /ParaSET/tools/builder/install.sh   paraset  sun4-O

        You can ignore the error that it cannot copy the RCS directory
   exit  back to regular user;  don't stay as superuser, or builder

4. As jon, add a line to the history file.  This line should indicate the
   date, what the new directory was called, and a comment.

-----------------------------------------
To cut a tape from one of the releases:

1.  rlogin tweety      (machine on Kevin's desk)
    su                 (no environment variables needed)
    cd  /integ/paraset.1
    cd  paraset.xxxxxxxx     (whatever release is desired)
    tar  cvf  /dev/rst0  paraset
           ("Permission denied"  means the tape is write-protected)
    (this takes about 10 minutes)
    tar   tvf  /dev/rst0      (shows table of contents)
    use  ^C to abort after a few lines come out

    No unmount command needed
    Wait a minute or so for tape to stop rewinding

    Remove the tape & write-protect it

2.  Blank tapes & labels are in office next to Alena
    Alena knows how to make up new version numbers when needed
