How to update the splash screen:

As of today, we have  new procedure for updating splash screens:

This will be a pain in the ass, but will hopefully outlive gala and our usage of Galaxy


Here's how to do it:
1) check out the file /paraset/data/images/splash.psd
2) find a machine with PhotoShop 3.0 or higher; use that to edit the image.
3) The image currently consists of roughly 22 layers. The two that get changed most often are the
DateLayer and the 
VersionLayer
4) To change one of these,  first select it (read the Help on Layers if you don't know how to do this).  Using the lasso tool lasso the offending text
5) Using the Type tool, type in new text.  Note that the font for the Version number is Garamond (30 pt, I believe).
6) Save the file.

Now here is where the fun begins:
The intersection between the set of image formats that PhotoShop will export, and those that Galaxy's VRE will import is the null set.  Consequently you will need to use an intermediate graphics program--e.g. Corel Photo-Paint.

7) File...Save A Copy as--pick EPS (or Tiff)
8) open the .eps file in Photo-Paint  Choose Image__Convert
pick 8 bit.
pick custom
pick 16 colors.
save it as 
splash16.bmp
repeat with 65536 colors.
save it as
splash65.bmp

Now you should have
two bitmapped images.

To import them into the VRE:
open the relevent vr file (/paraset/src/clients/splash/src/splash.vr
or /paraset/src/clients/gala/src/gala.vr)
find the dialog with the splash screen
open the properties submenu of that dialog by clicking on the little triangle.
go to ObjectList--open it.
Inside you will find an image object labelled '0'
open it.
Using the Image menu, import the new splash screen.
Save the VR file.
you are now done!
